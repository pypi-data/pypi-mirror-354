- `generate_derivs_contraction.py` : Generates the derivatives of the contractions.
- `generate_integrals.py` : Computes the integrals of the point-charge
between two primitive Gaussians between all kinds of sub-shells, e.g. s-px, px-dxx, py-px.
- `generate_recursive_coeffs.py` : Generates all of the nuclear-attraction integrals coefficients between all 
sub-shells.
