### Language distances and information

This repository combines a number of sources to obtain information and
distances for languages. It focuses on ISO639-3 languages, and combines
information from a variety of sources.

### Usage
The package is located in `src/distals/`, and can be used from the 
commandline: `python3 src/distals/distals.py`.

Its main function is to provide a user with distance metrics between
two languages. This can be obtained by adding `--lang1` and `--lang2`
to the command. For example:
```
python3 src/distals/distals.py --lang1 fry --lang2 dan
```

The distances are calculated based on information from existing databases. 
This information is loaded from a pickle file (default `distals-db.pickle.gz`), 
and a full database is included in this repo. It can also easily be updated, 
by using the `--update_database` option and the `--update_textbased` option. 

The package also depends on language code and language names conversion. 
The database for this is included in `langname-db.pickle.gz`, this can 
re-created with the `--cache_langnames` option.

For now, we assume all source data to be available in the `data/` folder. The
data can be updated using the `scripts/0.update.sh` script. So to update the 
database completely, one has to run:
```
./scripts/0.update.sh
python3 src/distals/distals.py --update_database
```

To update the textbased features, the LTI-LangId corpus needs to be downloaded, 
which takes a substantial amount of time (weeks), the steps for doing so can be
seen in `0.get_miltale.sh`.

It should be noted that all metrics are designed to have values between 0 and
1, and they are not directional. In cases where a metric could not be
estimated, the code returns a -1.

### Metrics

* **aes_dist**: first collects the Agglomerated Endangerment Scale (AES)
  category for each language, and then calculates how many groups apart they
are. See also https://glottolog.org/langdoc/status , the extraction of these
values was done with the `scripts/getAES.py` script, and based on GlottoLog 5.0

* **asjp_lev_dist**: Calculates the LDND distance on the ASJP word lists as
  defined in ``Adding typology to lexicostatistics: A combined approach to
language classification''. Unfortunately, there is no 1-1 mapping between the
language codes in ASJP and ISO639-3 codes, so we made an automatic mapping
based on the language name provided in ASJP and other sources. The script for
this is in `scripts/complete_lists.py` and the results in `data/aspj_conv`. We
use the normalized levenshtein as provided by ASJP
(https://asjp.clld.org/software). When multiple versions of a word are
available, we use the average (this was underspecified in the original paper,
and we could not find reference implementations).

* **lang2vec**: Cosine distance between lang2vec vectors, only taking into
  account values that overlap. Note that this metric is thus hard to compare
across language pairs, as different linguistic features will be
included/excluded for different language pairs.

* **lang2vec_knn**: Cosine distance between lang2vec vectors which have been
  completed through KNN by the original paper. 

* **lang_fam**: The percentage of trees of distance. This means that if you are
  in two different trees, it will always be 2.0. If both languages are in the
same tree it is #overlapping edges/the total edges of the deepest language of
the two.

* **lang_group**: distance between language groups as defined in ``The State
  and Fate of Linguistic Diversity and Inclusion in the NLP World''.
Unfortunately, I could not obtain the language codes, but have made an
automatic mapping (`scripts/complete_lang2tax.py`), which is available in
`data/lang2tax.txt.codes`.

* **script**: We use the set of scripts used for a language as collected by
  ``GlotScript: A Resource and Tool for Low Resource Writing System
Identification''. We then calculate the percentage of overlap and inverse
(1-overlap) to obtain a distance metric. We ignore Braille (brai) in the
calculations, as the information for this script is incomplete.

* **speakers**: Number of speakers as reported by ASPJ, these are based on
  numbers from an old version of Ethnologue. Transformed to a distance metric
by dividing the smallest by the largest number.

* **wiki_size**: Wikipedia size, which is extracted from a download of the
  Wikipedia page ``List_of_Wikipedias'', downloaded on 17-04-2024. Transformed
to a distance metric by dividing the smallest by the largest number.


### Citations
Please provide the correct citations when using any of these metrics. People
have spend a lot of their valuable time providing us with this data. Also, I
would be interested to hear about your project if you find this repository
useful, so would appreciate a link/short description e-mailed to me
(robv@itu.dk).
