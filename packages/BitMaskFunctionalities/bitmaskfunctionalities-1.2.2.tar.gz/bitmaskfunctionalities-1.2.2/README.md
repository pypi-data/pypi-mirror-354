A BitMask Python module

This module provides a `BitMask` class for efficient manipulation and representation of binary data as a fixed-length
sequence of bits.

It allows initializing a bitmask with a specified length and an optional starting value, provides methods for common
bitwise operations such as setting, resetting, and flipping individual or all bits.
Includes other useful functionalities for various properties of the bitmask.

The BitMask class is useful for bit manipulation, flag management, or compact binary representations of data.
