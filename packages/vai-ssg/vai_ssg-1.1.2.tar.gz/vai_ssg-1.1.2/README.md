Vai is a Static Site Generator (SSG) that takes your source content written in Markdown, applies a theme to it, and generates static HTML pages that can be easily deployed anywhere. Optionally, It also allows easy modification of css styling, javascript logic and html strucutre layout as well! This is a hobby project made in my free time 🤗

## ✨ Key Features
 - 📱 **Responsive Design**: Looks great on any devices — no extra setup required.
- 🔎 **Full-Text Search**: Automatically builds a search index for all your pages and headings.
- 🎨 **Syntax Highlighting**: Beautiful code blocks out of the box.
- 💅 **Custom Blocks**: Create admonitions for notes, warnings, and tips.
- ⚙️ **Simple Configuration**: Control your site's navigation from a single `config.yaml` file.
- 📦 **Zero Dependencies**: The final site is just pure HTML, CSS, and JS. No backend needed.
- 🐢 **Live Reload Server**: See your changes instantly as you write. However, it is not as robust as other SSG such as VitePress. You may have to manually refersh at times. u can `Ctrl+r` for quick refresh though.
