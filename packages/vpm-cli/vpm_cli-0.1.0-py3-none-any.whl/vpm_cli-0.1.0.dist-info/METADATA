# vpm
Virtual Property Manager (VPM) is the open source smart home operating system the world deserves. Lightweight, cross platform, command line application that builds a COBie 3.0 and IFC compliant model of your home, manages preventative maintenance tasks and logs, and organizes your home’s documents.

## Design Principles:
1. **Data Sovereignty:** You control your home's data in perpetuity.
2. **Portability:** Conform to open standards with easy import and export.
3. **Interoperability:** Do core functions well, and integrate with other services. No walled gardens.
4. **Unenshitifiable:** Product design must make it impossible to enshitify.

## Problem Statement
1. Homeowners are not professional property managers. They don't know what needs to be done to proactively maintain their home so that everything works, they minimize maintenance costs, and keep it in good condition.
2. Home maintenance information online is generic and often caveated. Most homeowners don't have the expertise to be confident they are appropriately interpreting and applying the general advice.
3. Homeowners have to develop their own information management and task management systems for their homes.
4. Tasks that would be quick for a professional property manager with experience and relationships, such as identifying what trade is needed to fix a problem, getting and assessing bids (including benchmarking to general market costs), and hiring a contractor they trust are much harder for homeowners who only need contractor service intermittently.
5. Smart home technology adds a layer of complexity and fragility to a home, rather than making homes more robust and self maintaining.

## Integrations Roadmap
### Smart Device Management Platforms 
* Google Home
* Apple HomeKit

### Task Management
* Apple renders
* Google to do
* MS ToDo
* Any.Do

## VPM Web
VPM Web is a subscription service built on VPM that provides cloud storage, multi-home support, automated maintenance tasks and reminders, simplified replacement parts ordering (in USA only for now), and a chatbot trained on your home’s data and manuals.

VPM Web stays true to the open-core ethos and prevents enshitifcation by allowing you to stop the subscription and keep a fully functioning local VPM model.
