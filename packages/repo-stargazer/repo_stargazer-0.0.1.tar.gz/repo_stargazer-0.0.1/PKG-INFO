# The Repo Stargazer

## Problem

I have been starring github projects for a long time. 

There are two primary intentions behind giving stars -

* Recognize the efforts of the author
* Bookmark the repository for my own use

The problem is how does one search the starred repositories. The interface
provided by github.com is very primitive

## Solution

This project uses semantic search as an attempt to solve the above problem.

## Install

```bash
# Are you still using pip? Come on man!
uv add repo-stargazer
```

## Usgage

TBD
