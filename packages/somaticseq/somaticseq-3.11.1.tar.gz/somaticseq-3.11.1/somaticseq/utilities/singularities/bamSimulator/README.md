<b>Mutation Simulation Pipeline in Singularities</b>

**Requirement**

-   Have internet connection and Singularity. Be able to pull docker images from
    Docker Hub.
-   **Highly recommended**: Have cluster management system with valid "qsub"
    command, such as Sun Grid Engine (SGE).

This is ported from the
[dockered pipeline](../../dockered_pipelines/bamSimulator). Commands are
identical, except these scripts will run on singularities instead of docker
daemon. Use the same set of commands, substitute "dockered_pipelines" in the
command path for "singularities."
