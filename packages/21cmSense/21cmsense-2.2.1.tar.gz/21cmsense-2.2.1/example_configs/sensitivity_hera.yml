# This file denotes a default configuration for a sensitivity calculation for HERA
# All arguments apply to the sensitivity.PowerSpectrum object -- look at the docs
# for that object, or use `help(PowerSpectrum)` in an interpreter to see available
# options.

# One option that is extra to the PowerSpectrum options is the "plugins" option below.
# This should be a list of dot-pathed modules that should be imported in order to have
# your custom plugins loaded (example, TheoryModel subclasses).
plugins:
  - py21cmsense.theory
#  - my_custom_package.module

# The observation.
# Either a file containing configuration options for the observation, or a dict
# of key: value pairs.
