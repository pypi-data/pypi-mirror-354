# Machine Learning Training Base (ml-training-base)

`ml-training-base` is a Python library providing base classes and utilities for supervised machine learning projects. It includes:
* A configurable logging setup for both console and file outputs. 
* Base classes for data loaders (`BaseSupervisedDataLoader`).
* An environment setup class for deterministic training (`TrainingEnvironment`), ensuring reproducible runs.
* A base trainer class (`BaseSupervisedTrainer`) that outlines a typical training workflow in supervised learning.

By using these abstractions, you can quickly spin up a new ML pipeline with consistent structure and easily extend or override specific components to suit your needs.

## Features
* Reusable Base Classes: Standard building blocks for data loading, training, callbacks, and environment management. 
* Logging Utilities: Automatically configure logging to both console and file, with customizable logging paths. 
* Deterministic Environment Setup: Control Python, NumPy, and TensorFlow seeds for reproducible ML experiments. 
* Clear Project Structure: Easily extend or override abstract methods in your own data loaders, trainers, or environment logic.

## Installation
You can install this package locally via:
```
pip install ml-training-base
```

## Quick Start
1. **Install** the package and its dependencies.
2. **Create** a YAML configuration file (e.g. `config.yaml`) with your environment, logging, and data settings.
3. **Import** the classes in your script or Jupyter notebook:
```
import logging
from ml_training_base.data.utils.logging_utils import configure_logger
from ml_training_base.training.environment.environment import TrainingEnvironment
from ml_training_base.training.trainer import BaseSupervisedTrainer
```
4. **Set up** your environment and trainer:
```
# For example, a custom trainer that inherits from BaseSupervisedTrainer
class MyCustomTrainer(BaseSupervisedTrainer):
    def _setup_model(self):
        # Initialize your model here, e.g., a TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch model
        pass

    def _build_model(self):
        # Compile or build your model
        pass

    def _setup_callbacks(self):
        # Setup your training callbacks, checkpointing, etc.
        pass

    def _train(self):
        # Implement your training loop or model.fit(...) call
        pass

    def _save_model(self):
        # Save trained model to disk
        pass

    def _evaluate(self):
        # Evaluate your model on the test set
        pass

# Usage:
trainer = MyCustomTrainer(
    config_path="path/to/config.yaml",
    training_env=TrainingEnvironment(logger=logging.getLogger(__name__))
)
trainer.run()
```

### Key Modules
* `data/utils/logging_utils.py`:
  * Contains `configure_logger(log_path)` which sets up console/file logging.
* `training/environment/base_environment.py`: 
  * Abstract base class `BaseEnvironment` for environment setup tasks.
* `training/environment/training_environment.py`: 
  * Implementation of `TrainingEnvironment`, enabling deterministic training (sets seeds, configures TensorFlow ops, etc.).
* `training/trainer.py`: 
  * Contains `BaseSupervisedTrainer`, an abstract class to streamline a typical training workflow (environment setup, model creation, training loop, evaluation).
