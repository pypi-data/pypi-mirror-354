# EvalBench 
`EvalBench` is a plug-and-play Python package for evaluating outputs of large language models (LLMs) across a variety of metrics - from response quality and retrieval accuracy to hallucination and prompt alignment.

It now includes agentic workflows: just describe what you want to understand or improve about your LLM outputs, and EvalBench will plan and execute a tailored sequence of evaluation, interpretation, and recommendation steps — automatically!

### 🚀 Key Features:
- 18+ built-in metrics covering coherence, relevance, hallucination, BLEU, ROUGE, MRR, and more
- User-defined custom metrics with a simple decorator-based API
- Modular architecture to group related metrics and share inputs
- Agentic execution: EvalBench can reason about your goal and execute the necessary steps (evaluate → interpret → recommend)
- Batch support, configurable output (print/save), and JSON-compatible results

### 📊 Modules and Metric Categories:

| Module               | Metrics                                                                      |

| response_alignment    | response_relevance_score, response_helpfulness_score                         | 
| user defined module               | User-registered custom metrics                                               | 

### 🧠 Agentic Workflow:
EvalBench follows a three-step agentic pipeline, automatically triggered based on user instructions:

1. Evaluation – Runs relevant metrics to score model outputs. EvalBench intelligently selects which metrics to use if not explicitly specified.
2. Interpretation – Analyzes the evaluation results and highlights potential issues with model behavior.
3. Recommendation – Suggests improvements to prompts, model setup, data inputs, or evaluation strategy.

Just write your request in plain language — EvalBench will take care of the rest.

## 🚀 Usage
```bash
pip install evalbench
```

All usage examples, including how to write your own custom metrics and how to use the agentic pipeline in practice, are available in this Jupyter notebook:

## 💡 Use Cases
EvalBench is ideal for:
- Evaluating LLM apps like summarizers, chatbots, and search agents using built-in metrics
- Integrating custom, domain-specific metrics into the EvalBench's ecosystem
- Getting automatic eval → interpret → recommend pipelines from natural language instructions
- Rapidly iterating on model outputs, prompts, and evaluation strategies
