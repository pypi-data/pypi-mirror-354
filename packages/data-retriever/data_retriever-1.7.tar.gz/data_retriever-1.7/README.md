# I-ETL
The ETL algorithm creates interoperable databases for the BETTER project. It relies on MongoDB to store the data and reads a .env file for the configuration. The code is written in Python and encapsulated in a Docker.


## 1. Requirements

- Docker Desktop is installed on the host machine.
- **All input files are in the same folder on your machine, and they have the exact same name as specified in the metadata.**
  - Specifically for VCF data: 
    - You can group them in a sub-folder (or not).
    - If you grouped them in a folder, e.g., named `vcf-folder`, please provide `vcf-folder/*.vcf` for the data files in the `.env` file.
    - If you did not group them, please provide `*.vcf` for the data files in the `.env` file.
    - The VCF files should be named with the patient ID (exactly and only the patient ID used the other data).
- **In your data files: variables are columns, patients are rows** and patient have identifiers (which will be further anonymized by I-ETL).
- **The column name for the patient ID, respectively the sample ID, is the same for all the files used to build the database.**

## 2. Use I-ETL to create an interoperable database with your data

1. Get the image of the I-ETL:
  - Either download the TAR image available in the repository (recommended)
    - Go to the deployment artifacts page: https://git.rwth-aachen.de/padme-development/external/better/data-cataloging/etl/-/artifacts
    - Click on the "folder" icon of the latest valid build (the most recent one with a green &#9745;)
    - Download the **TAR archive** named `the-ietl-image.tar` (be sure to download a `.tar`, not a `.zip`)
  - Or build it from the repository (not recommended, see section "For developers")
2. Download the `comose.yaml` file, available in the repository (https://git.rwth-aachen.de/padme-development/external/better/data-cataloging/etl/-/blob/main/compose.yaml?ref_type=heads)
3. Download the settings file `.env` file, available in the repository (https://git.rwth-aachen.de/padme-development/external/better/data-cataloging/etl/-/blob/main/.env?ref_type=heads)
4. Download your metadata file in the Better Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1J-3C2g06WbC1gUE_3KaDp3_v1uKHXxFV
  - `ES-HSJD-variables.xlsx` for SJD hospital
  - `IT-BUZZI-variables.xlsx` for BUZZI hospital in use-case 1
  - `RS-IMGGE-variables.xlsx` for IMGGE hospital
  - `UC2-variables.xlsx` for LAFE and HMC hospitals
  - `UC3-variables-02-04-2025.xlsx` for TERRASSA, UKK and BUZZI hospitals
4. Create a folder, e.g., named `better`, with:
  - The I-ETL Docker (TAR) image 
  - The `.env` file template
  - The `compose.yaml` file
  - The metadata file
5. In that folder, load the TAR image within the Docker: `docker load < the-ietl-image.tar`
6. In that folder, fill the `.env` file with your own settings (see Section 3)
7. In that folder, launch I-ETL by running the following commands:
  - `export CONTEXT_MODE=DEV`
  - `export ETL_ENV_FILE_NAME=.env`
  - `export ABSOLUTE_PATH_ENV_FILE=X` where `X` is the absolute path to your `.env` file
  - `docker compose --env-file ${ABSOLUTE_PATH_ENV_FILE} up -d` (`-d` stands for `--daemon`, meaning that I-ETL will run as a background process).
7. To check whether I-ETL has finished, you can run `docker ps`: if `the-etl` does not show in the list, this means that it is done.
8. To check the logs of the ETL, you have two options: 
  - If you have specified the parameter `SERVER_FOLDER_LOG_ETL` in your `.env`, you can look at the log files produced in the folder you specified in that parameter;
  - Otherwise, use `docker logs the-etl`.

## 3. Parameters in the `.env` file

The `.env` file is a file to specify several parameters that I-ETL needs to run properly. 
This includes parameters about the database, the files to use, the language, etc.

The provided `.env` file is a _template_: you have to fill each parameter with your own value.

## 4. Querying the ETL database within a train

### Steps 
Given a user input (explained below), the class `DataRetriever` takes care of:
1. Generating the MongoDB query to fetch the data in the database
2. Loading the retrieved data in a Pandas DataFrame

The user input is:
- the information to connect to the database (MongoDB URL and database name)
- the features (also called "variables") the user is interested in when collecting data
- the post-process methods to "flatten"/"normalize" the data values if needed

### Example 

A main example is available in the `query.py` file (https://git.rwth-aachen.de/padme-development/external/better/data-cataloging/etl/-/blob/main/src/query.py).  
Lines 9 and 10, respectively 18 and 19, contain the user input:
- The variable `FEATURE_CODES` is a dictionary (map) to asociate a variable name to the ontology term that has been associated to it in the metadata (https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1J-3C2g06WbC1gUE_3KaDp3_v1uKHXxFV)
- The variable `FEATURES_VALUE_PROCESS` is a dictionary (map) to associate each variable to a MongoDB operator to process/flatten the fetched values. It should be used for the variables leadning to non-atomic values (especially dictionaries). If no process is neede (because the value is atomic) or you do not know which MongoDB operator to choose, use `None`.

The next lines create a new `DataRetriever` with the information for the MongoDB connection and your user variables. The method `run()` generates the MongoDB query to fetch the data from the specified database. 
Then, it loads the fetched data into a DataFrame. This DataFrame is accessible in the variable `the_dataframe` (see `dataRetriever.the_dataframe`). Finally, the dataframe is exported as a CSV file.

The package is available in `pip` meaning that it should be added to the requirements of the train (as in `pip install data-retriever`). Current version is 1.4. To be sure that you have all the required package:
1. Download the `requirements.txt` file in this repository
2. Create a virtual Python environement (using Python venv or Anaconda)
3. Activate that environement
4. Install all the reauied packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install the `data-retriever` package with `pip install data-retriever`
6. Then, you should adapt the main file `query.py` with your own settings (database name, etc)
7. Finally, you can run the `query.py` file with `python3 query.py`


## 5. For developers

### Build the Docker image

To be used when working with the I-ETL repository

1. Install Docker Desktop and open it
2. From the root of the project, run `docker build . --tag ietl`
3. If an error saying `ERROR: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at XXX. Is the docker daemon running?` occurs, Docker Desktop has not started. 
4. If an error saying `error getting credentials` occurs while building, go to your Docker config file (probably `~/.docker/config.json`) and remove the line `credsStore`. Then, save the file and build again the image.

### Steps to deploy the Docker image within a center

To be used when deploying I-ETL within a center

1. Locally, build the Docker image: see above section
2. Locally, create a TAR image of I-ETL (only with the ETL, not with the mongo): `docker save ietl > the-ietl-image.tar`
3. Send that TAR image to the host machine, e.g., using `scp the-ietl-image.tar "username@A.B.C.D:/somewhere/in/host/machine"`
4. Send the env file to the host machine in the same folder as the TAR image, e.g., using `scp .env "username@A.B.C.D:/somewhere/in/host/machine"`
5. Send the compose file to the host machine in the same folder as the TAR image, e.g., using `scp compose.yaml "username@A.B.C.D:/somewhere/in/host/machine`
6. In the host machine, move to `/somewhere/in/host/machine/` using `cd /somewhere/in/host/machine`
7. In the host machine, load the TAR image within the Docker of the host machine: `docker load < the-ietl-image.tar`
8. In the host machine, follow any above scenario, i.e., tune the .env file and run I-ETL
