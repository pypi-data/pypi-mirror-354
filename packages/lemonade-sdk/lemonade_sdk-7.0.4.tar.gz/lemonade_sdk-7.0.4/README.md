## üçã Lemonade SDK: Quickly serve, benchmark and deploy LLMs

The [Lemonade SDK](./docs/README.md) is designed to make it easy to serve, benchmark, and deploy large language models (LLMs) on a variety of hardware platforms, including CPU, GPU, and NPU.

</div>

The [Lemonade SDK](./docs/README.md) is comprised of the following:

- üåê **Lemonade Server**: A server interface that uses the standard Open AI API, allowing applications to integrate with local LLMs.
- üêç **Lemonade Python API**: Offers High-Level API for easy integration of Lemonade LLMs into Python applications and Low-Level API for custom experiments.
- üñ•Ô∏è **Lemonade CLI**: The `lemonade` CLI lets you mix-and-match LLMs, frameworks (PyTorch, ONNX, GGUF), and measurement tools to run experiments. The available tools are:
  - Prompting an LLM.
  - Measuring the accuracy of an LLM using a variety of tests.
  - Benchmarking an LLM to get the time-to-first-token and tokens per second.
  - Profiling the memory usage of an LLM.
