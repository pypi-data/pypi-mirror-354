- User authentication with hashed passwords and session management
- Encrypted file metadata stored securely in SQLite
- Audit logging capturing file access and user actions
- Containerized deployment using Docker and Docker Compose
- Continuous Integration and Deployment pipeline with linting and tests (GitHub Actions)

## Security Principles

- Confidentiality: AES-256 encryption ensures stored files remain confidential
- Integrity: File hashing verifies integrity of uploaded files
- Accountability: Access logs provide traceability of user actions
- Compliance: Architecture inspired by ISO27001 and GDPR principles to promote security-by-design and privacy awareness

## DevOps

- Docker for consistent environment and easy deployment
- Unit tests with Pytest
- CI/CD pipeline configured with GitHub Actions for automated testing and code quality checks
