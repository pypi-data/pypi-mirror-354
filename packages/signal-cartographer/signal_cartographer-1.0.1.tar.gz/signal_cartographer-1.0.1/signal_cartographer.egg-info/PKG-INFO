## 💡 Pro Tips

### Efficiency & Strategy
- **Use TAB completion** for faster command entry
- **Focus on progression** - analyze signals to earn Analysis Points
- **Upgrade strategically** - Scanner Sensitivity first for more signals
- **Save frequently** with named saves for different playthroughs
- **Monitor performance** with the PERFORMANCE command
- **Explore systematically** - master each sector before advancing

### Advanced Techniques
- **Sector progression** - Complete lower sectors before attempting DELTA-4 or EPSILON-5
- **Achievement hunting** - Use ACHIEVEMENTS command to track progress
- **Equipment synergy** - Combine upgrades for maximum effectiveness
- **Pattern recognition** - Look for relationships between signals in different sectors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Can't see signals?** → Run `SCAN` first to detect signals in current sector
- **FOCUS not working?** → Ensure signals exist after scanning; try `SCAN` again
- **ANALYZE gives no results?** → Focus on a signal first using `FOCUS SIG_1`
- **Commands not working?** → Commands are case-insensitive; try TAB completion
- **Performance issues?** → Use `PERFORMANCE CLEANUP` to free memory

### Save System
- **Save failed?** → Check disk space and permissions; saves go to `saves/` directory
- **Load failed?** → Verify filename exists; use `LOAD` without filename to see available saves
- **Corrupted save?** → Delete the corrupted file and use an earlier save or start new game
