## Summary

- **Total Tests**: 0
- **Tests Available**: 0
- **Note**: This is a static analysis of the audit test suite without executing the tests.

## Additional Recommendations

The following recommendations are based on best practices identified in the audit code:

- **Code Review:** Perform manual code reviews focusing on logic, clarity, security, and adherence to LangGraph/Pydantic AI patterns.
- **Static Analysis:** Use tools like `mypy` for type checking and `flake8` or `ruff` for linting.
- **Test Coverage:** Integrate `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage and identify untested code paths.
- **Dependency Management:** Ensure `requirements.txt` is accurate and minimal. Audit third-party library licenses if necessary.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Ensure logging provides sufficient detail for debugging production issues. Integrate with monitoring tools (like LangSmith).
