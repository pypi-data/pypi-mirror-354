For each subtask, include implementation details, error handling considerations, and integration points.",

For each subtask, include implementation details and test scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting which requires careful implementation. The high complexity comes from handling various error scenarios, implementing retry mechanisms, and ensuring proper rate limit compliance."

For each subtask, include implementation details and test scenarios.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing two related resource modules with complex data structures. The complexity is high due to the relationship between workspaces and spaces and the detailed TypeScript interfaces required."

The complexity is very high due to the sophisticated rate limiting queue, async iterator implementation, and the need to create clear, accurate documentation with examples."
