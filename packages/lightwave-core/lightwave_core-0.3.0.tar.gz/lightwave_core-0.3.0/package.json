It provides shared utilities, abstract models, interfaces, and common services with minimal dependencies. This package is designed to be imported and used by other LightWave applications rather than running as a standalone service. It's versioned, published to a private package repository, and follows clean architecture principles as a \"Pure Library\" with strict separation of concerns",
