# Overview
The Lightwave Authentication and API Gateway System provides a centralized authentication service and API gateway for the entire Lightwave ecosystem (createos.io, cineos.io, photographyos.io, photo-workflows.com, joelschaeffer.com, and lightwave-media.site). This system ensures secure, standardized access control across all applications while maintaining high performance, reliability, and comprehensive logging for security audits.

- Future third-party OAuth support (Google, Apple, Meta)

## 2. API Gateway
- Centralized routing and load balancing
- Request/response transformation
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API versioning support
- Service discovery integration
- Circuit breaker implementation
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) management

## 3. Logging and Monitoring
- Centralized logging system
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Security audit trails
