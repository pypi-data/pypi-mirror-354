class ReplayBuffer:
    """!
    @brief Python wrapper around replay buffer implemented in C++.

    @details
    The implementation is based on the following papers:

    <b>Prioritized experience replay</b>,
    published on arXiv, 2015.

    Authors:
    - Tom Schaul

    <b>Learning to predict by the methods of temporal differences</b>,
    published in Machine learning, 3:9–44, 1988.

    Authors:
    - Richard S. Sutton

    More precisely, the replay buffer supports multistep Q-learning and
    prioritization of experiences according to their associated loss.
