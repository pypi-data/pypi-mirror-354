# weather_rp5

This package provides functions for automatically retrieving weather records from the rp5.ru website.

## Installation

To install this project, run:
```
pip install weather_rp5
```

## Example Usage

To get records for the weather station in Poitiers starting on February 1, 2024
and ending on April 1, 2024, you may use the following code:
```
from datetime import date
import pandas as pd
from weather_rp5 import get_station_id, get_weather_data

url = 'https://rp5.ru/Weather_archive_in_Poitiers_(airport)'
wmo_id = get_station_id(url)
start = date(2024, 2, 1)
end = date(2024, 4, 1)
df = get_weather_data(wmo_id, start, end, False)
```
If you need data from the airport (METAR) station, you may proceed as follows:
```
url = 'https://rp5.ru/Weather_archive_in_Sao_Paulo_(airport),_METAR'
station_id = get_station_id(url)
start = date(2024, 2, 1)
end = date(2024, 4, 1)
df = get_weather_data(station_id, start, end, True)
```
