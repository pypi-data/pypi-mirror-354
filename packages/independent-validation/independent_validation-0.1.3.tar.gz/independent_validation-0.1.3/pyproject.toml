description = "IV is a Python package designed to assess the accuracy of machine learning classifiers by generating a full probability distribution of their performance. This method goes beyond traditional cross-validation by using an iterative process and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate uncertainty. By only using samples for training after they have been tested alpha inflation is prevented."
