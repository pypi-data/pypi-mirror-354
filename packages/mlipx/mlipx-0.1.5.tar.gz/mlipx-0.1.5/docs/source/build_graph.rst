Build your own Graph
=====================

This section goes into more detail for adding your own :term:`ZnTrack` Node and designing a custom workflow.
You will learn how to include :term:`MLIP` that can not be interfaced with the :code:`GenericASECalculator` Node.
With your own custom Nodes you can build more comprehensive test cases or go even beyond :term:`MLIP` testing and build workflows for other scenarios, such as :term:`MLIP` training with :code:`mlipx` and :term:`IPSuite`.
