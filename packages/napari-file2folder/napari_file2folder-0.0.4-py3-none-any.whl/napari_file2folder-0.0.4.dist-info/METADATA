A plugin to inspect bioimages (e.g. .tif, .czi, .nd2, .lsm...) and save them as individual .tif files in a folder.

`napari-file2folder` is a [napari] plugin that is part of the [Tapenade](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade) project. Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).

## Overview

<img src="imgs/napari-file2folder-demo.gif"/>

This plugin allows you to inspect (possibly large) bioimages by displaying their shape (number of elements in each dimension), and allowing you to save each element along a chosen dimension as a separate .tif file in a folder. This is useful when you have a large movie or stack of images and you want to save each frame or slice as a separate file. Optionally, the plugin allows the user to visualize the middle element of a given dimension to help the user decide which dimension to save as separate files.

The plugin currently supports the following file formats:
- .tif
- .ome.tiff
- .zarr
- .ome.zarr
- .nd2
- .lsm
- .czi

This plugin leverages [tifffile], [bioio], and [zarr] to circumvent loading the entire images in memory, which allows inspection of very large images.

> [!CAUTION]
> When inspecting the middle element of a dimension, or when saving one element of a dimension as a separate file, the plugin loads the element in memory, which means that at least this lone element must fit in memory.

## Installation

The plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).
