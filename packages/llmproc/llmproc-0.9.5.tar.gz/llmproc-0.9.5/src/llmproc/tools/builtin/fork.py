# Detailed fork tool description explaining the Unix metaphor and usage patterns
fork_tool_description = """
You can use this tool to fork the conversation into multiple instances of yourself and let each instance continue answering and using tools.
This is analogous to the fork() system call in Unix.

pid = fork([PROMPT]) # prompt to yourself to continue the conversation

if pid == 0:
    # child process
    You'll receive PROMPT as the tool_result and continue the conversation
else:
    # parent process
    You'll wait for all children to finish and receive the final message from each instance in the following format
    [
        {
            "id": 0,
            "message": "the final message from the child process"
        },
    ]

Different from Unix, you can fork multiple children at once:
fork([PROMPT0, PROMPT1, PROMPT2, ...])

When to use this tool:
You can fork yourself to do tasks that would otherwise fill up the context length but only the final result matters.
For example, if you need to read a large file to find certain details, or if you need to execute multiple tools step by step but you don't need the intermediate results.

You can fork multiple instances to perform tasks in parallel without performing them in serial which would quickly fill up the context length.
Each forked process has a complete copy of the conversation history up to the fork point, ensuring continuity and context preservation.
