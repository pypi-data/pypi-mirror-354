When you create code examples:
- Always wrap code in reference tags for easy export
- Use clear, descriptive reference IDs
- Provide explanation before and after the code
- Mention that the user can export specific references to files

Whenever you generate multiple examples, create a separate reference for each one.

For each example:
1. Wrap the code in reference tags with descriptive IDs
2. Explain what the code does and how it works
3. Show how I could export each example to a file using the fd_to_file tool

I'd like to see how the reference system works with different types of code.
