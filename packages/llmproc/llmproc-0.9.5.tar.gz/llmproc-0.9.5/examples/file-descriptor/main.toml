- Read by page: read_fd(fd="fd:1", start=0)
- Read all: read_fd(fd="fd:1", read_all=true)
- Export: fd_to_file(fd="fd:1", file_path="output.txt")

Try reading large files like README.md to see the system in action."""

1. Use read_file to read the README.md file, which will create a file descriptor
2. Show how to read the first page of the file descriptor
3. Show how to read the entire file descriptor content
4. Explain how you would export the file descriptor to a text file

Explain what the file descriptor system is and why it's useful for handling large content.
