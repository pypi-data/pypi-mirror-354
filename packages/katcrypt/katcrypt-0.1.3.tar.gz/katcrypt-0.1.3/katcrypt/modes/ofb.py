"""
Output Feedback (OFB) Mode

OFB is a block cipher mode that operates like a stream cipher. The block cipher
encrypts the initialization vector (or previous keystream block) to produce
a keystream, which is then XORed with the plaintext. Unlike CFB, OFB uses the
keystream output as feedback, not the ciphertext, making encryption and decryption
identical operations.

class OFB:
   """
   Output Feedback (OFB) mode of operation.

   In OFB mode, the block cipher encrypts the previous keystream block (or IV)
   to create the next keystream block that is XORed with the plaintext:
   K[0] = E(K, IV)
   K[i] = E(K, K[i-1]) for i > 0
   C[i] = P[i] âŠ• K[i]

   OFB mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher and does not require padding.
   Encryption and decryption are identical operations.
