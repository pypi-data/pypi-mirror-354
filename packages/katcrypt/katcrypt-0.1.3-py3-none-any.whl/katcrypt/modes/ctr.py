"""
Counter (CTR) Mode

CTR is a block cipher mode that operates like a stream cipher. The block cipher
encrypts a counter value to produce a keystream, which is then XORed with the
plaintext. The counter is typically composed of a nonce and a counter value.
CTR mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher and does not require padding.
Encryption and decryption are identical operations.

   Counter (CTR) mode of operation.

   In CTR mode, the block cipher encrypts a counter value to create
   a keystream that is XORed with the plaintext:
   CTR[i] = Nonce || Counter[i]
   K[i] = E(K, CTR[i])
   C[i] = P[i] âŠ• K[i]

   CTR mode turns a block cipher into a stream cipher and does not require padding.
   Encryption and decryption are identical operations.
