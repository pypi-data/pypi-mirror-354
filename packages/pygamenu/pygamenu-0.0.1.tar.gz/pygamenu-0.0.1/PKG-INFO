Maybe I'll add docs, Maybe I won't!


# How to use

1. Read through the code (Because I'm a random stranger on the internet)

2. Download the `pymenu` folder.

3. Put the `pymenu` folder in the `lib` section of your project

4. Put `Import lib.pymenu as pm` in your code

5. Code some stuff in a `.pym` file according to the docs (If those don't exist just look at the example really hard)

6. Create a view using this syntax`View = pm.initialize('path_from_working_dir/abcd.pym', size:Point)`

7. In your main loop add 
```python
for event in pg.event.get():

    View.passEvent(event, globals())
``` 

8. Read the docs for more info (Or do trial and error and try to figure out what my custom error messages mean)
