## Features

- Interactive tutorials for MCP setup and development
- Step-by-step guides for different MCP hosts (Claude, Cursor, Custom)
- Comprehensive coverage of MCP concepts:

The build tool used in the instructions is Hatch, so you'll need to install it as well:

```bash
brew install hatch
```
