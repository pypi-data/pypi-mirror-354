hello_mcp.step2.intro,"Now that we have our basic configuration file, let's add the filesystem server to enable file operations."
hello_mcp.step2.update,"Update your configuration file with the following content:"
hello_mcp.step2.reminder,"Remember to replace 'username' with your actual username"
hello_mcp.step2.explanation,"This configuration enables the filesystem server, which allows MCP to interact with your files."
hello_mcp.step3.title,"Step 3: Install Required Dependencies"
hello_mcp.step3.intro,"To use the filesystem server, we need to install Node.js and the required npm package."
hello_mcp.step3.instruction,"First, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then run:"
hello_mcp.step3.restart,"After installation, restart your application to apply the changes."
