# rebound-compare

A lightweight Python library to compare the evolution of two REBOUND simulations side-by-side.

## Features

- Track and compare orbital elements (`a`, `e`, `i`, etc.)
- Detect and visualize divergence due to added bodies (e.g., Planet Nine)
- Plot time evolution of orbital parameters
- Integrates cleanly with any REBOUND simulation

## Installation

```bash
pip install rebound-compare
