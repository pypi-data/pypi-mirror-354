Welcome to the **Python** implementation of the KuCoin Universal SDK. This SDK is built based on KuCoin API specifications to provide a comprehensive and optimized interface for interacting with the KuCoin platform.

For an overview of the project and SDKs in other languages, refer to the [Main README](https://github.com/kucoin/kucoin-universal-sdk).

## üì¶ Installation

### Latest Version: `1.3.0`
Install the Python SDK using `pip`:

```bash
pip install kucoin-universal-sdk
```

## üìñ Getting Started

Here's a quick example to get you started with the SDK in **Python**.

```python
import logging
import os

from kucoin_universal_sdk.api import DefaultClient
from kucoin_universal_sdk.generate.spot.market import GetPartOrderBookReqBuilder
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model import ClientOptionBuilder
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model import GLOBAL_API_ENDPOINT, GLOBAL_FUTURES_API_ENDPOINT, \
    GLOBAL_BROKER_API_ENDPOINT
from kucoin_universal_sdk.model import TransportOptionBuilder


def example():
    logging.basicConfig(
        level=logging.INFO,
        format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)s - %(message)s',
        datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
    )

    #  Retrieve API secret information from environment variables
    key = os.getenv("API_KEY", "")
    secret = os.getenv("API_SECRET", "")
    passphrase = os.getenv("API_PASSPHRASE", "")

    # Set specific options, others will fall back to default values
    http_transport_option = (
        TransportOptionBuilder()
        .set_keep_alive(True)
        .set_max_pool_size(10)
        .set_max_connection_per_pool(10)
        .build()
    )

    # Create a client using the specified options
    client_option = (
        ClientOptionBuilder()
        .set_key(key)
        .set_secret(secret)
        .set_passphrase(passphrase)
        .set_spot_endpoint(GLOBAL_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_futures_endpoint(GLOBAL_FUTURES_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_broker_endpoint(GLOBAL_BROKER_API_ENDPOINT)
        .set_transport_option(http_transport_option)
        .build()
    )
    client = DefaultClient(client_option)

    # Get the Restful Service
    kucoin_rest_service = client.rest_service()

    spot_market_api = kucoin_rest_service.get_spot_service().get_market_api()

    # Query for part orderbook depth data. (aggregated by price)
    request = GetPartOrderBookReqBuilder().set_symbol("BTC-USDT").set_size("20").build()
    response = spot_market_api.get_part_order_book(request)
    logging.info(f"time={response.time}, sequence={response.sequence}, "
                 f"bids={response.bids}, asks={response.asks}")

## üìå Special Notes on APIs

This section provides specific considerations and recommendations for using the REST and WebSocket APIs.

### REST API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Advanced HTTP Handling**:
  - Supports retries, persistent connections, and connection pooling for efficient request handling.
- **Extensible Interceptors**:
  - Provides HTTP interceptors that users can extend to customize request and response processing.
- **Rich Response Details**:
  - Includes rate-limiting information and raw response data in API responses for better debugging and control.
- **Public API Access**:
  - For public endpoints, API keys are not required, simplifying integration for non-authenticated use cases.

---

### WebSocket API Notes

#### Client Features
- **Flexible Service Creation**:
  - Supports creating services for public/private channels in Spot, Futures, or Margin trading as needed.
  - Multiple services can be created independently.
- **Service Lifecycle**:
  - If a service is closed, create a new service instead of reusing it to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Connection-to-Channel Mapping**:
  - Each WebSocket connection corresponds to a specific channel type. For example:
    - Spot public/private and Futures public/private services require 4 active WebSocket connections.

#### Threading and Callbacks
- **Simple Thread Model**:
  - WebSocket services follow a simple thread model, ensuring callbacks are handled on a single thread.
- **Subscription Management**:
  - Subscriptions are synchronous. A subscription is considered successful only after receiving an acknowledgment (ACK) from the server.
  - Each subscription has a unique ID, which can be used for unsubscribe.

#### Data and Message Handling
- **Framework-Managed Threads**:
  - Data messages are handled by a single framework-managed thread, ensuring orderly processing.
- **Buffer Management**:
  - When the message buffer is full, excess messages are dropped, and a notification event is sent.
- **Duplicate Subscriptions**:
  - Avoid overlapping subscription parameters. For example:
    - Subscribing to `["BTC-USDT", "ETH-USDT"]` and then to `["ETH-USDT", "DOGE-USDT"]` may result in undefined behavior.
    - Identical subscriptions will raise an error for duplicate subscriptions.

## üìë Parameter Descriptions

This section provides details about the configurable parameters for both HTTP and WebSocket client behavior.
