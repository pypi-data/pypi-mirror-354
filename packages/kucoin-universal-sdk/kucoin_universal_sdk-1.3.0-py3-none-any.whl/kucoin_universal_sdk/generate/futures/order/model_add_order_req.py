        side (SideEnum): Specify if the order is to 'buy' or 'sell'.
        symbol (str): Symbol of the contract. Please refer to [Get Symbol endpoint: symbol](https://www.kucoin.com/docs-new/api-3470220) 
        leverage (int): Used to calculate the margin to be frozen for the order. If you are to close the position, this parameter is not required.
        type (TypeEnum): Specify if the order is a 'limit' order or 'market' order
        remark (str): Remark for the order: Length cannot exceed 100 utf8 characters
        stop (StopEnum): Either 'down' or 'up'.  If stop is used, parameter stopPrice and stopPriceType also need to be provided.
        stop_price_type (StopPriceTypeEnum): Either 'TP', 'IP' or 'MP', Need to be defined if stop is specified.
        stop_price (str): Needs to be defined if stop is specified. 
        reduce_only (bool): A mark to reduce the position size only. Set to false by default. Need to set the position size when reduceOnly is true. If set to true, only the orders reducing the position size will be executed. If the reduce-only order size exceeds the position size, the extra size will be canceled.
        close_order (bool): A mark to close the position. Set to false by default. If closeOrder is set to true, the system will close the position and the position size will become 0. Side, Size and Leverage fields can be left empty and the system will determine the side and size automatically.
        force_hold (bool): A mark to force-hold the funds for an order, even though it's an order to reduce the position size. This helps the order stay on the order book and not get canceled when the position size changes. Set to false by default. The system will force-freeze a certain amount of funds for this order, including orders whose direction is opposite to the current positions.

The post-only flag ensures that the trader always pays the maker fee and provides liquidity to the order book. If any part of the order is going to pay taker fees, the order will be fully rejected.
        hidden (bool): Optional for type is 'limit' order, orders not displaying in order book. When hidden is chosen, choosing postOnly is not allowed.
        iceberg (bool): Optional for type is 'limit' order, Only visible portion of the order is displayed in the order book. When iceberg is chosen, choosing postOnly is not allowed.
        visible_size (str): Optional for type is 'limit' order, the maximum visible size of an iceberg order. Please place order in size (lots). The units of qty (base currency) and valueQty (value) are not supported. Need to be defined if iceberg is specified.
        qty (str): **Choose one of size, qty, valueQty**. Order size (base currency) must be an integer multiple of the multiplier. The unit of the quantity of coin-swap is size (lot), which is not supported.
