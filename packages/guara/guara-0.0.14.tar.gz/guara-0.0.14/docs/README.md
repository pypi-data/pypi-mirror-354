## What is Guar√°?

Guar√° is a Python framework designed to simplify UI test automation. Inspired by design patterns like **Page Objects**, **App Actions**, and **Screenplay**, Guar√° focuses on **Page Transactions**‚Äîencapsulating user interactions (transactions) on web pages, such as Login, Logout, or Form Submissions. It‚Äôs not just a tool; it‚Äôs a programming pattern that can be adapted to any web driver, not just Selenium.

### Why Guar√°?
- **Simplicity**: Reduces repetitive code by encapsulating web interactions into reusable transactions.
- **Flexibility**: Works with any web driver, not limited to Selenium.
- **Clarity**: Makes test scripts more readable and maintainable.

## Quick Start

### Installation
Guar√° requires **Python 3.8+**. Install it via pip:
```shell
pip install guara
```

### Syntax
```python
Application.at(apage.DoSomething [,with_parameter=value, ...]).asserts(it.Matches, a_condition)
```

### Example in Action
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from pages import home, contact, info, setup
from guara.transaction import Application
from guara import it

def test_sample_web_page():
    # Initialize the Application with a driver
    app = Application(webdriver.Chrome())
    
    # Open the web application
    app.at(setup.OpenApp, url="https://anyhost.com/")
    
    # Change language to Portuguese and assert content
    app.at(home.ChangeToPortuguese).asserts(it.IsEqualTo, content_in_portuguese)

    # Navigate to Info page and assert text presence
    app.at(info.NavigateTo).asserts(it.Contains, "This project was born")

    # Close the web application
    app.at(setup.CloseApp)
```

### Behind the Scenes
The repetitive web driver code is encapsulated in a transaction class:
```python
from guara.transaction import AbstractTransaction

class ChangeToPortuguese(AbstractTransaction):
    def do(self, **kwargs):
        self._driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".btn:nth-child(3) > button:nth-child(1) > img").click()
        self._driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, ".col-md-10").click()
        return self._driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "label:nth-child(1)").text
```

## Key Features

### 1. **Page Transactions**
- Encapsulates user actions into reusable transactions.
- Reduces boilerplate code and improves readability.

### 2. **Flexible Assertions**
- Use built-in assertions like `it.IsEqualTo`, `it.Contains`, and more to validate outcomes.

### 3. **Cross-Driver Compatibility**
- Works with Selenium and can be adapted to other web drivers.

### 4. **Asynchronous Execution**
- Supports asynchronous operations for modern web applications.

### 5. **ChatGPT Assistance**
- Leverage AI to generate or debug transactions.

## Why the Name "Guar√°"?
Guar√° is the Tupi‚ÄìGuarani name for the **Scarlet Ibis**, a vibrant bird native to South America. Just like the bird, Guar√° stands out for its simplicity and elegance in solving complex UI automation challenges.
