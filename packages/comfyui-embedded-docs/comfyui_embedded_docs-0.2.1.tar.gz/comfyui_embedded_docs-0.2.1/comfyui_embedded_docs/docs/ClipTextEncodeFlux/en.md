Text Encoding: Uses the CLIP model to encode the text input in clip_l, capturing key features and semantic information from the text.
Enhanced Text Understanding: Utilizes the T5XXL large language model to process the t5xxl input, potentially expanding or refining text descriptions to provide richer semantic information.
Multimodal Fusion: Combines the processing results from CLIP and T5XXL to create a more comprehensive text representation.
Generation Control: Adjusts the influence of text prompts on image generation through the guidance parameter, allowing users to find a balance between creative freedom and strict adherence to prompts.
Conditional Data Generation: Outputs processed conditional data, which will be used in subsequent image generation processes to ensure that the generated images match the text descriptions.

## Inputs

| Parameter  | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `clip`     | CLIP      | CLIP model object input, used for text encoding and processing, typically used with DualCLIPLoader |
| `clip_l`   | STRING    | Multi-line text input, enter text similar to tag information for CLIP model encoding |
| `t5xxl`    | STRING    | Multi-line text input, enter natural language prompt descriptions for T5XXL model encoding |
| `guidance` | FLOAT     | Floating-point value, used to guide the generation process; higher values increase image-prompt matching but may reduce creativity |

## Outputs

| Parameter      | Data Type | Description |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| `CONDITIONING` | Condition | Contains conditional data (cond) for subsequent conditional generation tasks |
