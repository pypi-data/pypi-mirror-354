# Best Practices for Maintaining Your Changelog

1. **Always Update the Changelog:** Add entries as you implement changes, not just before release.
2. **Group Changes by Type:**

-   `Added` for new features
-   `Changed` for changes in existing functionality
-   `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features
-   `Removed` for now removed features
-   `Fixed` for any bug fixes
-   `Security` for vulnerability fixes

3. **Keep an "Unreleased" Section:** Track changes that haven't been - released yet.

4. **Date Format:** Use YYYY-MM-DD format for release dates.

5. **Link to Release Tags:** Add links to GitHub/GitLab release tags at the bottom of the file (if applicable).

6. **Mention Breaking Changes Prominently:** Make sure users can easily identify changes that might break their code.

7. **Use Plain Language:** Write for humans, not machines. Explain the impact of changes.

## Sample Implementation with Git Integration

If you're using Git, you can enhance your changelog management:

1. Create a release branch:`git checkout -b release/0.1.0`

2. Update version number in your project files and changelog

3. Commit the changes: `git commit -am "Release 0.1.0"`

4. Create a git tag: `git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release 0.1.0"`

5. Push to remote: `git push origin release/0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`

This process ensures your changelog and version information are always in sync with your actual releases.

## Additional Tools

Consider using automated changelog generation tools to help maintain your changelog:

-   **auto-changelog:** Generates a changelog from git metadata
-   **standard-version:** Automates versioning and CHANGELOG generation
-   **keep-a-changelog:** Helps generate changelogs following the Keep a Changelog format
