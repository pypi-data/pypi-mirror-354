Vulnerability Index Example
===========================

This example demonstrates how to generate and use time-based vulnerability indices.

.. code-block:: python

    from verus.data import TimeWindowGenerator
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Create time window generator
    tw_generator = TimeWindowGenerator(
        reference_date="2023-11-06",  # A Monday
        verbose=True
    )
    
    # Generate time windows based on typical opening hours
    time_windows = tw_generator.generate_from_schedule()
    
    # Print available categories
    print(f"Generated time windows for categories: {list(time_windows.keys())}")
    
    # Examine vulnerability indices for restaurants at different times
    school_hours = time_windows["school"]
    print("\School vulnerability indices throughout the day:")
    print(school_hours[["ts", "te", "vi"]].head(24))
