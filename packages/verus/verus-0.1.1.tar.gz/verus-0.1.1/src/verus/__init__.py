VERUS - Vulnerability Evaluation for Resilient Urban Systems

A comprehensive toolkit for urban vulnerability assessment through spatial analysis.

Core capabilities:
- Extract urban Points of Interest (POIs) from OpenStreetMap
- Apply time-based vulnerability indexing for different scenarios
- Identify meaningful POI clusters through advanced spatial clustering
- Calculate vulnerability using configurable distance metrics
- Apply spatial smoothing techniques to improve continuity
- Visualize vulnerability zones with interactive maps

Components:
- VERUS: Main vulnerability assessment class
- DataExtractor: POI extraction from OpenStreetMap
- TimeWindowGenerator: Time-based vulnerability indexing
- GeOPTICS: Density-based spatial clustering
- KMeansHaversine: Distance-aware K-means clustering
- HexagonGridGenerator: Spatial grid generation
