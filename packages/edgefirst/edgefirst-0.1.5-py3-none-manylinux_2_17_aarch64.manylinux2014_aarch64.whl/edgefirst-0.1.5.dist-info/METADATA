# EdgeFirst Launcher

This is the EdgeFirst Launcher which is responsible for managing the EdgeFirst Middleware in user-mode, which means a user launches the services manually from the command-line rather than system-managed where the services are under the control of systemd and installed into the system.

The user-mode Middleware is meant to be installed using `pip install edgefirst` which will install the service binaries, webui, and supporting assets such as the default people detection model.
