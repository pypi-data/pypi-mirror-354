title: "Documentation"
---

This repository uses [![](../assets/external_logos/quarto.png){width=85px}](https://quarto.org/) & [quartodoc](https://machow.github.io/quartodoc/get-started/overview.html)
for documentation. All files relating to the documentation are under the `docs/` directory.
Quarto & quartodoc provide very detailed documentation on usage so I will refer the reader to these
resources for more details.

To build the API documentation, run the following command from the projects root directory:

```bash
quartodoc build --config docs/_quarto.yml
```

To build the example notebooks (under `notebooks/examples/`, run the following command:

```bash
bash docs/marimo_examples_to_quarto.sh
```

And to preview the documentation, run the following command:

```bash
quarto preview docs/
```

The documentation preview will be hosted on [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
Note that the quarto preview will be checking for live updates & applying them in real-time.
In some cases, the changes will not manifest until you rerun `quartodoc build --config docs/_quarto.yml`.
In general, this will occur when you make changes to the "quartodoc:" section of the `docs/_quarto.yml` file or
any corresponding API changes.
