## About CISO-GENAI-Framework

The CISO-GENAI-Framework implements core concepts from **Causal Invariant Synergy Optimization (CISO)**, a novel approach designed to bring causal reasoning, geometric cooperation, and topological group discovery to multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). As Generative AI systems scale to many interacting LLMs and agents, coordinating their efforts becomes a significant challenge. CISO aims to cut through the noise, identify true causal contributions, foster intelligent collaboration, and dynamically discover effective agent teams.

This repository provides a foundational demo illustrating how the CISO components analyze agent interactions within a simple environment.

## Key Features

- **Causal Advantage Interventions**: Understands what truly made the difference in multi-agent outcomes, moving beyond mere correlation to pinpoint causal credit.
- **Emergent Synergy Manifolds**: Models the optimal collaboration surface among agents, aiming to unlock fluid and intelligent teamwork.
- **Topological Group Formation**: Dynamically discovers natural, high-performing agent groups based on their interactions and proximity in state space.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run the CISO-GENAI demo, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harshbopaliya/CISO-GENAI-Framework.git
cd CISO-GENAI-Framework
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is missing, install manually:
>
> ```bash
> pip install torch numpy gymnasium ripser PyYAML
> ```

## Running the Demo

Navigate to the root directory of the CISO-GENAI-Framework and run the demo application:

```bash
python -m agent_demo.demo_app
```

This will start a simulation in the GridWorld environment with three agents. The CISO framework components will analyze their interactions at each step.

## Understanding the Demo Output

The demo output will display information at each simulation step:

- **Agent Positions**: The (x, y) coordinates of each agent on the grid
- **Rewards**: The individual reward each agent receives (negative Euclidean distance to the grid center)
- **Causal Advantage (Global)**: A scalar value indicating the estimated global causal impact of the current state/actions
- **Emergent Synergy (Mean HJB Value)**: A scalar value approximating the overall synergy or fluidity of collaboration
- **Topological Groups Discovered**: A list of lists, where each inner list contains the numerical indices of agents identified as a cohesive group based on their proximity

> **Note**: `[]` (empty list) means no two agents are within the `topology_eps` threshold defined in `agent_demo/demo_config.yaml`. To see groups, consider increasing `topology_eps` (e.g., to 1.5, 2.0, or 2.5) as the grid coordinates are integers.

## Agents in the Demo

The demo features three agents with conceptual roles:

- **agent_0 (PlannerAgent)**: Conceptually for high-level strategy
- **agent_1 (CoderAgent)**: Conceptually for implementation logic
- **agent_2 (DebaterAgent)**: Conceptually for communication/conflict resolution

> **Important**: In this current demo, these agents are functionally identical. They all inherit from `BaseAgent` and use a stochastic policy to move randomly within the GridWorld, aiming for individual rewards based on proximity to the center. They do not perform specific "planning," "coding," or "debating" tasks. The names serve as a conceptual scaffold for future, more complex CISO implementations.

## Future Work & Contribution

This framework is a starting point for exploring CISO. Future work could include:

- Implementing actual learning algorithms (`learn` method) for agents
- Developing richer environments with more complex, collaborative tasks
- Introducing explicit communication channels and role-specific behaviors for agents
- Full implementation of the advanced mathematical formulations of CISO
