The `shrike` library is a set of Python utilities for running experiments in the 
[Azure Machine Learning](https://github.com/Azure/azureml-examples) platform (_a.k.a._ Azure ML). This
library contains four elements, which are:

-  `shrike.compliant_logging`: utilities for compliant logging and 
exception handling;
-  `shrike.pipeline`: helper code for managing, validating and submitting Azure
ML pipelines based on 
[azure-ml-component](https://aka.ms/azure-ml-component-reference) (_a.k.a._ the Component SDK);
-  `shrike.build`: helper code for packaging, building, validating, signing and
registering Azure ML components.
- `shrike.spark`: utilities for running jobs, especially those leveraging Spark
  .NET, in HDInsight and later Synapse.

## Documentation
For the full documentation of `shrike` with detailed examples and API reference, 
please see the [docs page](https://shrike-docs.com/).

For a list of problems (along with guidance and solutions) designed specifically
to help you learn how to use shrike, please refer to the information in
[this README file](https://github.com/Azure/azure-ml-problem-sets/blob/main/README.md#azure-ml-problems-aimed-at-learning-shrike)
(located in another GitHub repository).

## Installation

The `shrike` library is publicly available in PyPi. There are three optional extra dependencies: `pipeline`, `build`, and `dev`.
The `pipeline` dependency is for submitting Azure ML pipelines, `build` is for signing and registering components, 
and `dev` is for the development environment of `shrike`.

- If you are only planning on using the compliant-logging feature, please `pip install` without any extras:
```pwsh
pip install shrike
```
- If you are planning on signing and registering components, please `pip install` with `[build]`:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[build]
```
- If you are planning on submitting Azure ML pipelines, please `pip install` with `[pipeline]`:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[pipeline]
```
- If you would like to contribute to the source code, please `pip install` with all the dependencies:
```pwsh
pip install shrike[pipeline,build,dev]
```

Alternatively, for local development, you may use the Conda environment defined
in [environment.yml](./environment.yml). It pins the appropriate versions of
pip, Python, and installs all shrike together with all extras as an editable
package.

:warning: If you are using a ZSH terminal, please consider adding quotes,
e.g., `pip install "shrike[pipeline,build,dev]"` to avoid the accidental shell expansion.

## Migration from `aml-build-tooling`, `aml-ds-pipeline-contrib`, and `confidential-ml-utils`
If you have been using the `aml-build-tooling`, `aml-ds-pipeline-contrib`, or `confidential-ml-utils` libraries, 
please use the migration script ([migration.py](https://github.com/ai-platform-ml-platform/shrike/blob/main/migration.py)) to convert your repo or files and
adopt the `shrike` package with one simple command:
```pwsh
python migraton.py --input_path PATH/TO/YOUR/REPO/OR/FILE
```
:warning: This command will update files **in-place**. Please make a copy of your repo/file if you do not want to do so.
