## What is Xaibo?

Xaibo is a powerful, protocol-driven framework that enables developers to build sophisticated AI agents with unprecedented flexibility and modularity. By using well-defined interfaces and dependency injection, Xaibo allows you to create, test, and deploy AI systems that are both robust and easily maintainable.

!!! tip "Quick Start"
    **Prerequisites:** Python 3.10 or higher installed
    
    Get up and running with Xaibo in minutes:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uvx xaibo init my_project
    cd my_project
    uv run xaibo dev
    ```
    Start with our [Getting Started guide](tutorial/index.md) guide to create your first Xaibo agent

## Key Features

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-puzzle-outline: **Protocol-Based Architecture**

    ---

    Components interact through well-defined protocol interfaces, creating clear boundaries and enabling easy testing with mocks.

-   :material-swap-horizontal: **Dependency Injection**

    ---

    Explicitly declare what components need, making it easy to swap implementations and inject predictable mocks for testing.

-   :material-eye-outline: **Transparent Proxies**

    ---

    Every component is wrapped with observability that captures parameters, timing, and exceptions for complete visibility.

-   :material-chart-timeline-variant: **Comprehensive Event System**

    ---

    Built-in event system provides real-time monitoring, call sequences tracking, and performance insights.
