Climakitaegui
=============
A python toolkit for adding graphical user interface and visualization tools to the [Climakitae python package](https://github.com/cal-adapt/climakitae). It does not work standalone - climakitae needs to be installed as well.

**Note:** This package is in active development and should be considered a work in progress.
