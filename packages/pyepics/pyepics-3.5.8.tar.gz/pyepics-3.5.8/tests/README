This folder contains several tests of the Epics Channel Access Module,
including for automated testing.

To run the tests, you will need `softIoc` from epics base, and `procServ`.
With Anaconda Python, these can be installed with

    conda install -y -c conda-forge epics-base
    conda install -y -c lcls-ii procserv

Then, to run the tests, use

    cd Setup
    sh start_ioc.sh
    python simulator.py &
    ..

With that, any of the `test_*.py` tests in this folder can be run.

Older or more complex tests are in the UnsortedTests folder.  Those
may be of interest, but are not run as part of the CI process.
