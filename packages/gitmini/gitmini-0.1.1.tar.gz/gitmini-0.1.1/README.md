# GitMini

**GitMini** is a lightweight, minimal version control system built from scratch in Python. It replicates core Git commands like `init`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, and `checkout` — perfect for learning how Git works under the hood or experimenting with your own VCS.

This project has been uploaded to **PyPI**! Find the link here: https://pypi.org/project/gitmini/
