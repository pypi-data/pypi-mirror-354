# GitMini

**GitMini** is a lightweight, minimal version control system built from scratch in Python. It replicates core Git commands like `init`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, and `checkout` — perfect for learning how Git works under the hood or experimenting with your own VCS.

- `gitmini checkout` – Switch between branches or restore old versions
