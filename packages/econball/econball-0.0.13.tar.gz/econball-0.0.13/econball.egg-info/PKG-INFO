## Raison D'Ãªtre :thought_balloon:

`econball` aims to be a library for pulling in historical information about economic indicators and pricing. All its about is in timeseries denoted by days.

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:

`econball` is a functional library which simply aims to pull down and normalise as much economic data as possible. Within it there are different pullers for various forms of economic data, all outputting a single time series representing the entity. The data that it pulls down is:

1. FRED: Macroeconomic Signals
2. YFinance: Equity Tickers
3. Coinbase: Crypto Tickers
4. EFD: Senate Trades
5. OECD

## Installation :inbox_tray:

This is a python package hosted on pypi, so to install simply run the following command:

`pip install econball`

or install using this local repository:

`python setup.py install --old-and-unmanageable`

## Usage example :eyes:

The use of `tsuniverse` is entirely through code due to it being a library. It attempts to hide most of its complexity from the user, so it only has a few functions of relevance in its outward API.

### Generating Features

To generate features:

```python
from econball.pull import pull

df = pull()
```
