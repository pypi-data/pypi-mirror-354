"""This module contains dataset and dataloaders for standard "digit" datasets.

This module was used to perform comparative study of the gammalearn multi-task, loss balancing,
model architecture, etc. on standard datasets easier to manipulate than LST data.

It is now deprecated and will be removed in a future gammalearn version.
