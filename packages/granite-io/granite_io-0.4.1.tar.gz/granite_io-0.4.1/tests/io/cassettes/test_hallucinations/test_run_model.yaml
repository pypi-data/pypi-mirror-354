      0\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is an IBM-hosted component of the Continuous
      Delivery service. All of the data that you provide to Git Repos and Issue Tracking,
      including but not limited to source files, issues, pull requests, and project
      configuration properties, is managed securely within Continuous Delivery. However,
      Git Repos and Issue Tracking supports various mechanisms for exporting, sending,
      or otherwise sharing data to users and third parties. The ability of Git Repos
      and Issue Tracking to share information is typical of many social coding platforms.
      However, such sharing might conflict with regulatory controls that apply to
      your business. After you create a project in Git Repos and Issue Tracking, but
      before you entrust any files, issues, records, or other data with the project,
      review the project settings and change any settings that you deem necessary
      to protect your data. Settings to review include visibility levels, email notifications,
      integrations, web hooks, access tokens, deploy tokens, and deploy keys. Project
      visibility levels \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking projects can have one of
      the following visibility levels: private, internal, or public. * Private projects
      are visible only to project members. This setting is the default visibility
      level for new projects, and is the most secure visibility level for your data.
      * Internal projects are visible to all users that are logged in to IBM Cloud.
      * Public projects are visible to anyone. To limit project access to only project
      members, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. From the project sidebar, click
      Settings > General. 2. On the General Settings page, click Visibility > project
      features > permissions. 3. Locate the Project visibility setting. 4. Select
      Private, if it is not already selected. 5. Click Save changes. Project membership
      \n\nGit Repos and Issue Tracking is a cloud hosted social coding environment
      that is available to all Continuous Delivery users. If you are a Git Repos and
      Issue Tracking project Maintainer or Owner, you can invite any user and group
      members to the project. IBM Cloud places no restrictions on who you can invite
      to a project.\n\nDocument 1\nAfter you create a project in Git Repos and Issue

      settings \n\nBy default, Git Repos and Issue Tracking notifies project members
      by way of email about project activities. These emails typically include customer-owned
      data that was provided to Git Repos and Issue Tracking by users. For example,
      if a user posts a comment to an issue, Git Repos and Issue Tracking sends an
      email to all subscribers. The email includes information such as a copy of the
      comment, the user who posted it, and when the comment was posted. To turn off
      all email notifications for your project, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.
      From the project sidebar, click Settings > General. 2. On the **General Settings
      **page, click Visibility > project features > permissions. 3. Select the Disable
