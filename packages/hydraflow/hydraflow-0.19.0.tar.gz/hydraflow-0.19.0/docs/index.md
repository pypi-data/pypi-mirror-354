# HydraFlow: Streamline ML Experiment Workflows

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- ðŸš€ **Define and Run Experiments**
  Combine Hydra's configuration management with MLflow's experiment
  tracking for streamlined experiment workflows
- ðŸ”„ **Automate Workflows**
  Define reusable experiment workflows with YAML configuration and
  leverage extended sweep syntax for parameter exploration
- ðŸ“Š **Collect and Analyze Results**
  Gather, filter, and analyze experiment results with type-safe APIs
  for comprehensive insights

## What is HydraFlow?

HydraFlow seamlessly integrates [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and
[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) to create a comprehensive machine learning
experiment management framework. It provides a complete workflow from defining
experiments to execution and analysis, streamlining machine learning projects
from research to production.

### Key Integration Features

- **Automatic Configuration Tracking**: Hydra configurations are automatically
  saved as MLflow artifacts, ensuring complete reproducibility of experiments
- **Type-safe Configuration**: Leverage Python dataclasses for type-safe
  experiment configuration with full IDE support
- **Unified Workflow**: Connect configuration management and experiment tracking
  in a single, coherent workflow
- **Powerful Analysis Tools**: Analyze and compare experiments using
  configuration parameters captured from Hydra

### Hydra + MLflow = More Than the Sum of Parts

HydraFlow goes beyond simply using Hydra and MLflow side by side:

- **Parameter Sweep Integration**: Run Hydra multi-run sweeps with automatic
  MLflow experiment organization
- **Configuration-Aware Analysis**: Filter and group experiment results using
  Hydra configuration parameters
- **Reproducible Experiments**: Ensure experiments can be reliably reproduced
  with configuration-based definitions
- **Implementation Support**: Extend experiment analysis with custom
  domain-specific implementations

## Quick Installation

```bash
pip install hydraflow
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.13+
