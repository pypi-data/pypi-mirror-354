Please identify all protected health information (PHI) in the following clinical note. PHI includes all names and name variations (full names, first names only, last names with titles like 'Mr.', 'Ms.', or 'Dr.', or any other references to an individual, including patients and physicians), addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, medical record numbers, dates related to the individual (such as birth dates, admission dates, or appointment dates), and any other information that can be used to identify an individual.

For each piece of PHI, provide a 'description' field that explains its context or role in the clinical note without including specific names or other PHI. For names, use 'Patient Name' for the patient, 'Attending Physician Name' for the attending physician, 'Follow-up Physician Name' for the follow-up physician, etc., and ensure that all references to the same individual have the same description, regardless of how the name is presented. For other PHI, use descriptions like 'Date of Visit', 'Medical Record Number', 'Clinic Address', etc.

Provide the results as a JSON array, where each object has 'type', 'text', and 'description' fields, like this: [{{"type": "Name", "text": "John Doe", "description": "Patient Name"}}, {{"type": "Date", "text": "2023-01-01", "description": "Admission Date"}}, ...]. Ensure all references to individuals (patients and physicians) are included as separate 'Name' entries with appropriate generalized descriptions. Do not include any additional text in the response, only the JSON array wrapped in <think> reasoning </think> tags.
