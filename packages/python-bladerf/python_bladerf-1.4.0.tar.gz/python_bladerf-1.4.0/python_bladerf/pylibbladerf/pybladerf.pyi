Between specifying the PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_START and PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_END flags, there is no need for the user to the
pybladerf_metadata.timestamp field because the library will ensure the correct value is used, based upon the timestamp initially provided and the number of samples that have been sent.
'''
PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_END: int
'''
Mark the associated buffer as the end of a burst transmission. This will flush the remainder of the sync interface's current working buffer and enqueue samples into the hardware's transmit FIFO.

Specifying this flag and flushing the sync interface's working buffer implies that the next timestamp that can be transmitted is the current timestamp plus the duration of the burst that this flag is ending and the remaining length of the remaining buffer that is flushed. (The buffer size, in this case, is the `buffer_size` value passed to the previous pybladerf_sync_config() call.)

Rather than attempting to keep track of the number of samples sent with respect to buffer sizes, it is easiest to always assume 1 buffer's worth of time is required between bursts. In this case "buffer" refers to the `buffer_size` parameter provided to pybladerf_sync_config().) If this is too much time, consider using the PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP flag.

! NOTE !
    This is only used for the pybladerf_sync_tx() call. It is ignored by the pybladerf_sync_rx() call.
'''
PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_NOW: int
'''
Use this flag in conjunction with PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_START to indicate that the burst should be transmitted as soon as possible, as opposed to waiting for a specific timestamp.

When this flag is used, there is no need to set the pybladerf_metadata.timestamp field.
'''
PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP: int
'''
Use this flag within a burst (i.e., between the use of PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_START and PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_END) to specify that pybladerf_sync_tx() should read the pybladerf_metadata.timestamp field and zero-pad samples up to the specified timestamp. The provided samples will then be transmitted at that timestamp.

Use this flag when potentially flushing an entire buffer via the PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_END would yield an unacceptably large gap in the transmitted samples.

In some applications where a transmitter is constantly transmitting with extremely small gaps (less than a buffer), users may end up using a single PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_START, and then numerous calls to pybladerf_sync_tx() with the PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_UPDATE_TIMESTAMP flag set. The PYBLADERF_META_FLAG_TX_BURST_END would only be used to end the stream when shutting down.

    Values in the range [-2048, 2048) are used to represent [-1.0, 1.0).

    Note that the lower bound here is inclusive, and the upper bound is exclusive. Ensure that provided samples stay within [-2048, 2047].

    Samples consist of interleaved IQ value pairs, with I being the first value in the pair. Each value in the pair is a right-aligned, little-endian int16_t. The FPGA ensures that these values are sign-extended.

    When using this format the minimum required buffer size, in bytes, is:

        `buffer_size_min = (2 x num_samples x num_channels x sizeof(int16_t))`

    For example, to hold 2048 samples for one channel, a buffer must be at least 8192 bytes large.

    When a multi-channel pybladerf_channel_layout is selected, samples will be interleaved per channel. For example, with PYBLADERF_RX_X2 or PYBLADERF_TX_X2 (x2 MIMO), the buffer is structured like:

    ```html
        .-------------.--------------.--------------.------------------.

    Per the `buffer_size_min` formula above, 2048 samples for two channels will generate 4096 total samples, and require at least 16384 bytes.

    Implementors may use the interleaved buffers directly, or may use pybladerf_deinterleave_stream_buffer() / pybladerf_interleave_stream_buffer() if contiguous blocks of samples are desired.

    *The number of samples in a block is dependent upon the USB speed being used:
    - USB 2.0 Hi-Speed: 1024 samples
    - USB 3.0 SuperSpeed: 2048 samples

    When using the pybladerf_sync_rx() and pybladerf_sync_tx() functions, the above details are entirely transparent; the caller need not be concerned with these details. These functions take care of packing/unpacking the metadata into/from the underlying stream and convey this information through the pybladerf_metadata structure.

    However, when using the FN_STREAMING_ASYNC interface, the user is responsible for manually packing/unpacking the above metadata into/from their samples.
    '''
    PYBLADERF_FORMAT_SC8_Q7 = ...
    '''
    Signed, Complex 8-bit Q8. This is the native format of the DAC data.

    Values in the range [-128, 128) are used to represent [-1.0, 1.0). Note that the lower bound here is inclusive, and the upper bound is exclusive. Ensure that provided samples stay within [-128, 127].

    Samples consist of interleaved IQ value pairs, with I being the value in the pair. Each value in the pair is a right-aligned int8_t. The FPGA ensures that these values are sign-extended.

    ```html
        .--------------.--------------.
        | Bits 15...8  | Bits  7...0  |
        +--------------+--------------+
        |    Q[7..0]   |    I[7..0]   |
        .--------------.--------------.
    ```

    When using this format the minimum required buffer size, in bytes, is:
        `buffer_size_min = (2 x num_samples x num_channels x sizeof(int8_t))`

    For example, to hold 2048 samples for one channel, a buffer must be at least 4096 bytes large.

    When a multi-channel pybladerf_channel_layout is selected, samples will be interleaved per channel. For example, with PYBLADERF_RX_X2 or PYBLADERF_TX_X2 (x2 MIMO), the buffer is structured like:

    ```html
        .-------------.--------------.--------------.------------------.
        | Byte offset | Bits 15...8  | Bits  7...0  |    Description   |
        +-------------+--------------+--------------+------------------+
        |    0x00     |     Q0[0]    |     I0[0]    |  Ch 0, sample 0  |
        |    0x02     |     Q1[0]    |     I1[0]    |  Ch 1, sample 0  |
        |    0x04     |     Q0[1]    |     I0[1]    |  Ch 0, sample 1  |
        |    0x06     |     Q1[1]    |     I1[1]    |  Ch 1, sample 1  |
        |    ...      |      ...     |      ...     |        ...       |
        |    0xxx     |     Q0[n]    |     I0[n]    |  Ch 0, sample n  |
        |    0xxx     |     Q1[n]    |     I1[n]    |  Ch 1, sample n  |
        `-------------`--------------`--------------`------------------`
    ```

    Per the `buffer_size_min` formula above, 2048 samples for two channels will generate 4096 total samples, and require at least 8192 bytes.

    Implementors may use the interleaved buffers directly, or may use pybladerf_deinterleave_stream_buffer() / pybladerf_interleave_stream_buffer() if contiguous blocks of samples are desired.

    ```

    For IQ sample meta mode, the Meta version ID and Stream flags should currently be set to values 0x00 and 0x00, respectively.

    *The number of samples in a block is dependent upon the USB speed being used:
    - USB 2.0 Hi-Speed: 1024 samples
    - USB 3.0 SuperSpeed: 2048 samples

        '''
        Initialize a rx stream for use with asynchronous routines.

        This function will internally allocate data buffers, which will be provided to the API user in callback functions.

        The `buffers` output parameter populates a pointer to the list of allocated buffers. This allows the API user to implement a buffer management scheme to best suit his or her specific use case.

        Generally, one will want to set the `buffers` parameter to a value larger than the `num_transfers` parameter, and keep track of which buffers are currently "in-flight", versus those available for use.

        For example, for a transmit stream, modulated data can be actively written into free buffers while transfers of other buffers are occurring. Once a buffer has been filled with data, it can be marked 'in-flight' and be returned in a successive callback to transmit.

        The choice of values for the `num_transfers` and `buffer_size` should be made based upon the desired samplerate, and the stream timeout value specified via bladerf_set_stream_timeout(), which defaults to 1 second.

        For a given sample rate, the below relationship must be upheld to transmit or receive data without timeouts or dropped data.

        `Sample Rate > (Num Transfers  / Timeout) x Buffer Size`

        ...where Sample Rate is in samples per second, and Timeout is in seconds.

        To account for general system overhead, it is recommended to multiply the righthand side by 1.1 to 1.25.

        While increasing the number of buffers available provides additional elasticity, be aware that it also increases latency.
