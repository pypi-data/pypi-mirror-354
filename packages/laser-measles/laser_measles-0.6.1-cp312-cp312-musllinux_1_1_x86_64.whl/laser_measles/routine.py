"""
This module implements the Routine Immunization (RI) process for a population model. It includes the initialization
of RI coverage for patches, the assignment of MCV (Measles Containing Vaccine) status to agents, and the updating
of RI timers for agents.

Classes:

    RoutineImmunization: Manages the routine immunization process, including initialization, updating RI timers,
                         handling births, and plotting immunization status.

Functions:

    nb_update_ri_timers(count, ri_timers, susceptibility): Numba-optimized function to update RI timers and adjust
                                                           susceptibility when timers expire.
    set_mcv_status(model, istart, iend): Assigns MCV status to agents based on RI coverage and probabilities of MCV1
                                         and MCV2 take.
    set_mcv_timers(model, istart, iend): Sets the RI timers for agents based on their MCV status and predefined
                                         time ranges for MCV1 and MCV2.

Constants:

    GET_MCV1: Constant representing the status of an agent who has received an effective MCV1 vaccination.
    GET_MCV2: Constant representing the status of an agent who has received an effective MCV2 vaccination.
    GET_NONE: Constant representing the status of an unvaccinated agent or an agent with ineffective vaccination.
