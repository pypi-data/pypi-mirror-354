We provide a Python wrapper for the LADOK3 REST API\@.
This wrapper provide a useful object-oriented framework for working with LADOK 
and direct API calls that return the unprocessed JSON data directly from 
LADOK\@.

We also provide a command-line interface (CLI) for the library.
We then construct some useful (shell) scripts using this CLI\@.
These scripts automates the reporting of results from Canvas to LADOK\@.
