PSITIP
======

Python Symbolic Information Theoretic Inequality Prover

PSITIP is a computer algebra system for information theory written in Python. Random variables, expressions and regions are objects in Python that can be manipulated easily. Moreover, it implements a versatile deduction system for automated theorem proving. PSITIP supports features such as:

- Proving linear information inequalities via the linear programming method by Yeung and Zhang. The linear programming method was first implemented in the ITIP software developed by Yeung and Yan ( http://user-www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ITIP/ ).

- Automated inner and outer bounds for multiuser settings in network information theory (see the `Jupyter Notebook examples <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cheuktingli/psitip/tree/master/examples/>`_ ).

- Numerical optimization over distributions, and evaluation of rate regions involving auxiliary random variables.

- Interactive mode and Parsing LaTeX code.

- Finding examples of distributions where a set of constraints is satisfied.

- Fourier-Motzkin elimination.

- Discover inequalities via the convex hull method for polyhedron projection [Lassez-Lassez 1991].

- Non-Shannon-type inequalities.

- Integration with Jupyter Notebook and LaTeX output.

- Generation of human-readable proofs.

- Drawing information diagrams.

- User-defined information quantities.

WARNING
~~~~~~~

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. This program is a work in progress, and bugs are likely to exist. The deduction system is incomplete, meaning that it may fail to prove true statements (as expected in most automated deduction programs). On the other hand, declaring false statements to be true should be less common. If you encounter a false accept in PSITIP, please let the author know.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install `PSITIP <https://pypi.org/project/psitip/>`_ with its dependencies, use one of the following three options:

A. Default installation
-----------------------

Run (you might need to use :code:`python -m pip` or :code:`py -m pip` instead of :code:`pip`):

    .. code:: text

        pip install psitip


If you encounter an error when building pycddlib on Linux, refer to https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installation .

This will install PSITIP with default dependencies. The default solver is ortools.GLOP. If you want to choose which dependencies to install, or if you encounter an error, use one of the following two options instead.



B. Installation with conda (recommended)
----------------------------------------

1. Install Python via Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/).

2. Open Anaconda prompt and run:

    .. code:: text

        conda install -c conda-forge glpk
        conda install -c conda-forge pulp
        conda install -c conda-forge pyomo
        conda install -c conda-forge lark-parser
        conda install conda-forge::pylatexenc
        pip install ortools
        pip install pycddlib
        pip install --no-deps psitip

3. If you encounter an error when building pycddlib on Linux, refer to https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installation .

4. (Optional) Graphviz (https://graphviz.org/) is required for drawing Bayesian networks and communication network model. It can be installed via :code:`conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz`

5. (Optional) If numerical optimization is needed, also install PyTorch (https://pytorch.org/).


C. Installation with pip
------------------------

1. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Run (you might need to use :code:`python -m pip` or :code:`py -m pip` instead of :code:`pip`):

    .. code:: text

        pip install numpy
        pip install scipy
        pip install matplotlib
        pip install ortools
        pip install pulp
        pip install pyomo
        pip install lark-parser
        pip install pycddlib
        pip install pylatexenc
        pip install --no-deps psitip

3. If you encounter an error when building pycddlib on Linux, refer to https://pycddlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html#installation .

4. (Optional) The GLPK LP solver can be installed on https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/ or via conda.
