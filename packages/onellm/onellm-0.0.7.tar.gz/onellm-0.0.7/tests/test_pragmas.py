    """
    Demonstration of how coverage pragmas can be used for unreachable code.

    Since we're dealing with safety code that's structurally unreachable but important
    to have as a safeguard, the proper approach would be to add a coverage pragma.

    In the file with the unreachable code (retry.py), we would add:

    ```python
    # This should never be reached due to the re-raise above, but keeping for safety
    assert last_error is not None  # pragma: no branch
    raise last_error  # pragma: no cover
    ```

    This tells the coverage tool to:
    1. Not expect the branch leading to the assert to be covered
    2. Ignore line 123 (raise last_error) for coverage purposes

    This is the industry-standard approach for handling safety code that's meant
    to be unreachable but kept as a safeguard.
