# Refactoring Documentation

This directory contains documents related to the refactoring efforts for the `log_analyzer_mcp` project.

## Current Plan

The primary refactoring plan being followed is:

- [Refactoring Plan v2](./log_analyzer_refactoring_v2.md) - *Current active plan for enhancing log analysis capabilities, introducing a client module, and restructuring for core logic reuse.*

Please refer to the current plan for the latest status on refactoring tasks.

## Refactoring History and Phases

This section outlines the evolution of the refactoring process through different versions of the plan, corresponding to different phases of reshaping the codebase.

- **Phase 1: Initial Monorepo Separation and Standalone Setup**
  - Plan: [Refactoring Plan v1](./log_analyzer_refactoring_v1.md)
  - Description: Focused on making the `log_analyzer_mcp` project a standalone, functional package after being extracted from a larger monorepo. Addressed initial dependencies, path corrections, and basic project configuration.

- **Phase 2: Enhanced Log Analysis and Modularization**
  - Plan: [Refactoring Plan v2](./log_analyzer_refactoring_v2.md)
  - Description: Aims to significantly refactor the core log analysis logic for greater flexibility and configurability. Introduces a separate `log_analyzer_client` module for CLI interactions, promotes code reuse between the MCP server and client, and defines a clearer component structure.

## Overview of Goals

The overall refactoring process aims to:

- Modernize the `log_analyzer_mcp` codebase.
- Improve its structure for better maintainability and scalability.
- Establish a clear separation of concerns (core logic, MCP server, CLI client).
- Enhance test coverage and ensure code quality.
- Ensure the project aligns with current best practices.

Key areas of focus across all phases include:

- Dependency management with `hatch`.
- Robust test suites and comprehensive code coverage.
- Code cleanup and modernization.
- Clear and up-to-date documentation.
