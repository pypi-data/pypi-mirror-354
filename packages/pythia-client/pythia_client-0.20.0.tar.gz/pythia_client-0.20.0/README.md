# Pythia-Client

The Pythia-client exist to make it easier to interact with our internal Pythia API. **This is still a work in progress.
**        
Install it via pip ([link](https://pypi.org/project/pythia-client/)): `pip install pythia-client`.    
**Please note:** always use the latest version available, as it is synchronized with the currently deployed Pythia REST
API.  
Run `uv sync` in this folder to install a local python environment `.venv` containing all dependencies.
