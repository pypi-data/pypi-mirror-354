# Lepton3.5_Purethermal3

Software to run a FLIR Lepton 3.5 mounted on a Groupgets Purethermal3 board running on Windows 10.

# Installation

### From PyPi (Reccomended)

It is reccomended that you use either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

Run the commands below to create a fresh conda environment named lepton.

```shell
conda create -n lepton -y
conda activate lepton
```

Install pip in the environment.

```shell
conda install pip -y
```

Install `lepton-pt`

```shell
pip install lepton-pt
```

### From Source

It is reccomended that you use either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

Run the commands below to create a fresh conda environment named lepton.

```shell
conda create -n lepton -y
conda activate lepton
```

Install pip and git in the environment.

```shell
conda install pip git -y
```

Clone the Lepton3.5_Purethermal3 repository.

```git
git clone https://github.com/GrayKS3248/Lepton3.5_Purethermal3.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory and install the package.

```shell
cd Lepton3.5_Purethermal3
pip install .
```

# Usage

### Streaming

After the Lepton is seated in the Purethermal board and connected to a device via a USB-C,  activate the Conda environment in which this package is installed and start streaming the camera using the `leprun` command.

```shell
conda activate lepton
leprun
```

When you are finshed streaming, press the `esc` while the viewing window is active to terminate the streaming.

### Recording

After the Lepton is seated in the Purethermal board and connected to a device via a USB-C, activate the Conda environment in which this package is installed and start streaming the camera using the `leprun` command and the `-r` flag.

```shell
conda activate lepton
leprun -r
```

The `-r` flag indicates that you want to record what is being streamed. All generated data is saved in a folder named `rec_data`  in the current directory and after the recording is terminated, will be rendered into a `.avi` video also in the current directory.

When you are finshed recording, press the `esc` while the viewing window is active to terminate recording. Note that it will take some time after the recording is terminated to render the captured video.

### Other

You can use the `-h` flag to explore addtional flags and functionality.

```
leprun -h
```

# Homography Transform

This software supports post-processing image warping to focus on a quadrilateral region of interest (qROI). To begin, press `f` while the viewer window is active to open the focus window, shown in cyan. The aspect ratio and size of the focus window are adjusted using the mouse scroll wheel (the middle mouse button can be used to toggle between fast edit and slow edit). You can switch between which parameter you are adjusting using the right mouse click. 

Once the focus window is set, use the left mouse button to define the four corners of the qROI, shown in magenta. The corner of the focus box to which the selected qROI corner will be transformed is shown as a magenta dot on one of the focus box corners. Once all four corners are defined, a homography transformation will be applied so the qROI occupies the focus box.

To reset the qROI, press `r`.

To toggle the homography transform, press `f`.

# Common Errors

### Port and Socket

```
ImageShapeException
In function: _stream()
Captured image shape (358, 640) does not equal expected image shape
(160, 120). Are you sure the selected port is correct? NOTE: If captured
image shape is (61,80) the Lepton may be seated incorrectly and you 
should reseat its socket.
```

1. *The incorrect port is selected.* 
   
   To fix, try instead running:
   
   ```shell
   leprun -p A_PORT_NUMBER_THAT_IS_NOT_0
   ```
   
   Where `A_PORT_NUMBER_THAT_IS_NOT_0` is any integer that is not `0`. Each camera device has its own unique port identifier. This code defaults to using port `0` but if you have multiple cameras, the Lepton might be at a higher port number. The `-p` flag allows a users to change the selected port.

2. *The lepton is not seated properly in the Purethermal socket.*
   
   To fix, disconnect the Purethermal from power, completely remove the Lepton from the Purethermal socket, and reinsert it. After power is restored, you can try `leprun` again.

### Failed Recording

In some cases, a video may fail to gen generated after the recording is finished. This occurs most commonly when the recording frame rate was too low for the renderer to handle. To correct this issue avoid setting target frame rates below 5 fps.

### Lost Frames Every 3 Minutes

The FLIR Lepton camera uses automatic flat field correction (FFC) during operation to ensure image fidelity and prevent pixel drift. These automatic FFCs occur every 3 minutes and are predicated by a box reading "FFC" in the top left corner of the viewing window. They last approximately 3 seconds during which no thermal or telemetry data are transmitted by the camera resulting in dropped frames. This is unavoidable for proper Lepton function. Note the renderer automatically detects the dropped frames and locally adjusts the frame rate to maintain true playback speed.
