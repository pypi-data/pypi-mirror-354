        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
        information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

             available to the public including in ways that members of the

             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.
        
          a. Attribution.
        
               1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                  form), You must:
        
                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
        
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
        
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
             terminate automatically.
        
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
             Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the

# Lepton3.5_Purethermal3

Software to run a FLIR Lepton 3.5 mounted on a Groupgets Purethermal3 board running on Windows 10.

# Installation

### From PyPi (Reccomended)

It is reccomended that you use either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

Run the commands below to create a fresh conda environment named lepton.

```shell
conda create -n lepton -y
conda activate lepton
```

Install pip in the environment.

```shell
conda install pip -y
```

Install `lepton-pt`

```shell
pip install lepton-pt
```

### From Source

It is reccomended that you use either [Anaconda or Miniconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).

Run the commands below to create a fresh conda environment named lepton.

```shell
conda create -n lepton -y
conda activate lepton
```

Install pip and git in the environment.

```shell
conda install pip git -y
```

Clone the Lepton3.5_Purethermal3 repository.

```git
git clone https://github.com/GrayKS3248/Lepton3.5_Purethermal3.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory and install the package.

```shell
cd Lepton3.5_Purethermal3
pip install .
```

# Usage

### Streaming

After the Lepton is seated in the Purethermal board and connected to a device via a USB-C,  activate the Conda environment in which this package is installed and start streaming the camera using the `leprun` command.

```shell
conda activate lepton
leprun
```

When you are finshed streaming, press the `esc` while the viewing window is active to terminate the streaming.

### Recording

After the Lepton is seated in the Purethermal board and connected to a device via a USB-C, activate the Conda environment in which this package is installed and start streaming the camera using the `leprun` command and the `-r` flag.

```shell
conda activate lepton
leprun -r
```

The `-r` flag indicates that you want to record what is being streamed. All generated data is saved in a folder named `rec_data`  in the current directory and after the recording is terminated, will be rendered into a `.avi` video also in the current directory.

When you are finshed recording, press the `esc` while the viewing window is active to terminate recording. Note that it will take some time after the recording is terminated to render the captured video.

### Other

You can use the `-h` flag to explore addtional flags and functionality.

```
leprun -h
```

# Homography Transform

This software supports post-processing image warping to focus on a quadrilateral region of interest (qROI). To begin, press `f` while the viewer window is active to open the focus window, shown in cyan. The aspect ratio and size of the focus window are adjusted using the mouse scroll wheel (the middle mouse button can be used to toggle between fast edit and slow edit). You can switch between which parameter you are adjusting using the right mouse click. 

Once the focus window is set, use the left mouse button to define the four corners of the qROI, shown in magenta. The corner of the focus box to which the selected qROI corner will be transformed is shown as a magenta dot on one of the focus box corners. Once all four corners are defined, a homography transformation will be applied so the qROI occupies the focus box.

To reset the qROI, press `r`.

To toggle the homography transform, press `f`.

# Common Errors

### Port and Socket

```
ImageShapeException
In function: _stream()
Captured image shape (358, 640) does not equal expected image shape
(160, 120). Are you sure the selected port is correct? NOTE: If captured
image shape is (61,80) the Lepton may be seated incorrectly and you 
should reseat its socket.
```

1. *The incorrect port is selected.* 
   
   To fix, try instead running:
   
   ```shell
   leprun -p A_PORT_NUMBER_THAT_IS_NOT_0
   ```
   
   Where `A_PORT_NUMBER_THAT_IS_NOT_0` is any integer that is not `0`. Each camera device has its own unique port identifier. This code defaults to using port `0` but if you have multiple cameras, the Lepton might be at a higher port number. The `-p` flag allows a users to change the selected port.

2. *The lepton is not seated properly in the Purethermal socket.*
   
   To fix, disconnect the Purethermal from power, completely remove the Lepton from the Purethermal socket, and reinsert it. After power is restored, you can try `leprun` again.

### Failed Recording

In some cases, a video may fail to gen generated after the recording is finished. This occurs most commonly when the recording frame rate was too low for the renderer to handle. To correct this issue avoid setting target frame rates below 5 fps.

### Lost Frames Every 3 Minutes

The FLIR Lepton camera uses automatic flat field correction (FFC) during operation to ensure image fidelity and prevent pixel drift. These automatic FFCs occur every 3 minutes and are predicated by a box reading "FFC" in the top left corner of the viewing window. They last approximately 3 seconds during which no thermal or telemetry data are transmitted by the camera resulting in dropped frames. This is unavoidable for proper Lepton function. Note the renderer automatically detects the dropped frames and locally adjusts the frame rate to maintain true playback speed.
