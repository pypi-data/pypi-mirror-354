IMPORTANT WARNING: Alignment column 1 contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 1 column that contains only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

An alignment file with undetermined columns removed has already
been printed to file lactobacillus2.pylip.reduced
