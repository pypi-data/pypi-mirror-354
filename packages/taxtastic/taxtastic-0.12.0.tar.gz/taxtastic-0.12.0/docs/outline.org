* Taxtastic
** Introduction
Taxtastic combines two pieces of functionality: modifying and extracting from the NCBI taxonomy, and writing refpkgs for use with pplacer
** Taxonomy
*** Quickstart
An example with commands that downloads the NCBI taxonomy to build a database, then runs taxtable to extract a list of IDs and species names, updates the database with some new entries, and extracts a new taxtable from it.  Make it actually runnable.
*** Creating the database
*** Updating and altering the taxonomy
*** Taxtable and extracting subtaxonomies
