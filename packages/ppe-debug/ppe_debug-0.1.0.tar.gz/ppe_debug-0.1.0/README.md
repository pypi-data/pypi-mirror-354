# PPE - PrePrintExec

A lightweight, non-intrusive debugging tool that uses AST transformation to print debug information before executing your Python code.

## Why PPE?
Traditional comments help users understand code, but they are ignored at runtime. 
With PPE, your comments become actionable debug messages, making your code both readable and insightful during execution. 
This is especially valuable in complex functions 
-- PPE shows exactly which step is running and where errors occur, saving time during debugging.
```python
from ppe import ppe_debug

def risky_division(x, y):
    return x / y

@ppe_debug
def process_data(data):
    total = sum(data)  ## Summing data
    avg = total / len(data)  ## Calculating average
    # Many other complex operations...
    result = risky_division(avg, 0)  ## -
    return result


process_data([1, 2, 3])

# Output:
# PPE: Summing data
# PPE: Calculating average
# PPE: result = risky_division(avg, 0)
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   ...
# ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero
```
With PPE, you see exactly which step triggers the error, making debugging faster and clearer.

## Installation

```bash
pip install ppe-debug
```

## Quick Start
```python
from ppe import ppe_debug

@ppe_debug
def my_function():
    x = 10     ## Setting x value
    y = x * 2  ## -
    return y

result = my_function()
# Output:
# PPE: Setting x value
# PPE: y = x * 2
```

## Features

- üéØ **Non-intrusive**: Just add a decorator
- üîß **Multiple debug modes**: Custom messages, statement echoing, or variable inspection
- üöÄ **Zero dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
- üßπ **Clean**: Remove decorator to disable debugging
- üîç **Comprehensive**: Works with all Python statements

## Usage
### Custom Debug Messages
Use `## comments` to print your custom debug messages.
```python
@ppe_debug
def calculate():
    result = 10 + 5  ## Adding two numbers
    return result

# Output:
# PPE: Adding two numbers
```

### Statement Echoing
Use `## -` to echo the actual statement being executed.
```python
@ppe_debug
def calculate():
    result = 10 + 5  ## -
    return result

# Output:
# PPE: result = 10 + 5
```

### Variable Inspection
Use `## @var1,var2` to inspect variable values (prints after execution)  
Use `## @before:var1,var2` to inspect variables before execution   
Use `## @after:var1,var2` to explicitly inspect variables after execution  
Note that if some variables are not defined at the time of inspection, they will trigger an error.
```python
@ppe_debug
def calculate():
    a = 1  ## @a
    b = 2  ## @after:b
    c = a + b  ## @before:a,b
    d = 10  ## @before:d
    return c

# Output:
# PPE: [After] a=1
# PPE: [After] b=2
# PPE: [Before] a=1, b=2
# PPE: Variable inspection failed
```
