Hello {{user_name}},

This is an automated email from the HPC cluster{{cluster_name}}.

We have identified the following directories that are consuming cluster storage and require your attention:

Size      Directory
{% for source_path, size in source_paths|items %}{{ size }}{{ source_path }}
{% endfor %}
Please consider backing up these directories to Tier-1 Data if they contain valuable data.

You can use the globsync tool for this purpose. To get started, log in to the cluster and load the necessary modules:

    source {{load_modules_file}}

Next, run the following command for each of these paths:

    globsync flows start [--remove-source] PATH

The --remove-source option is optional and will ensure your data is removed after a successful transfer.

If you prefer to manually remove your data, you can monitor the status of your transfer at https://app.globus.org. Depending on your Globus settings, you will also receive an email notification upon successful completion of the transfer.

If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to reply to this email.

Best regards,

Samuel Corveleyn
