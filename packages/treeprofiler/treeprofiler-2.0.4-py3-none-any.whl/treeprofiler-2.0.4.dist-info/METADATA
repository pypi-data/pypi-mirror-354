License:                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                               Version 3, 29 June 2007
        
         Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
         Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
         of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
                                    Preamble
        
          The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
        software and other kinds of works.
        
          The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
        to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
        the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
        share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
        software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
        GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
        any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
        your programs, too.
        
          When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
        price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
        have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
        them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
        want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
        free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
        
          To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
        these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
        certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
        you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
        
          For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
        gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
        freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
        or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
        know their rights.
        
          Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
        (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
        giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
        
          For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
        that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
        authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
        changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
        authors of previous versions.
        
          Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
        modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
        can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
        protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
        pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
        use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
        have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
        products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
        stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
        of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
        
          Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
        States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
        software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
        avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
        make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
        patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
        
          The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
        modification follow.
        
                               TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
          0. Definitions.
        
          "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        
          "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
        works, such as semiconductor masks.
        
          "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
        License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
        "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
        
          To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
        in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
        exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
        earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
        
          A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
        on the Program.
        
          To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
        permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
        infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
        computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
        distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
        public, and in some countries other activities as well.
        
          To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
        parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
        a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
        
          An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
        to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
        feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
        tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
        extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
        work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
        the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
        menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
        
          1. Source Code.
        
          The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
        for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
        form of a work.
        
          A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
        standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
        interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
        is widely used among developers working in that language.
        
          The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
        than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
        packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
        Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
        Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
        implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
        "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
        (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
        (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
        produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
        
          The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
        the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
        work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
        control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
        System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
        programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
        which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
        includes interface definition files associated with source files for
        the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
        linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
        such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
        subprograms and other parts of the work.
        
          The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
        can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
        Source.
        
          The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
        same work.
        
          2. Basic Permissions.
        
          All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
        copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
        conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
        permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
        covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
        content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
        rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
        
          You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
        convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
        in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
        of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
        with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
        the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
        not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
        for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
        and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
        your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
        
          Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
        the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
        makes it unnecessary.
        
          3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
        
          No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
        measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
        11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
        similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
        measures.
        
          When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
        circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
        is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
        the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
        modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
        users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
        technological measures.
        
          4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
        
          You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
        receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
        appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
        keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
        non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
        keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
        recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
        
          You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
        and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
        
          5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
        
          You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
        produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
        terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
        
            a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
            it, and giving a relevant date.
        
            b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
            released under this License and any conditions added under section
            7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
            "keep intact all notices".
        
            c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
            License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
            License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
            additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
            regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
            permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
            invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
        
            d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
            Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
            interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
            work need not make them do so.
        
          A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
        works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
        and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
        in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
        "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
        used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
        beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
        in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
        parts of the aggregate.
        
          6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
        
          You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
        of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
        machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
        in one of these ways:
        
            a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
            Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
            customarily used for software interchange.
        
            b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
            (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
            written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
            long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
            model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
            copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
            product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
            medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
            more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
            conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
            Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
        
            c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
            written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
            alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
            only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
            with subsection 6b.
        
            d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
            place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
            Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
            further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
            Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
            copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
            may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
            that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
            clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
            Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
            Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
            available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
        
            e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
            you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
            Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
            charge under subsection 6d.
        
          A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
        from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
        included in conveying the object code work.
        
          A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
        tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
        or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
        into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
        doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
        product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
        typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
        of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
        actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
        is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
        commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
        the only significant mode of use of the product.
        
          "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
        procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
        and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
        a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
        suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
        code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
        modification has been made.
        
          If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
        specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
        part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
        User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
        fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
        Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
        by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
        if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
        modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
        been installed in ROM).
        
          The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
        requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
        for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
        the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
        network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
        adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
        protocols for communication across the network.
        
          Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
        in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
        documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
        source code form), and must require no special password or key for
        unpacking, reading or copying.
        
          7. Additional Terms.
        
          "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
        License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
        Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
        be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
        that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
        apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
        under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
        this License without regard to the additional permissions.
        
          When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
        remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
        it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
        removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
        additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
        for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
        add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
        that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
        
            a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
            terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
        
            b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
            author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
            Notices displayed by works containing it; or
        
            c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
            requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
            reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
        
            d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
            authors of the material; or
        
            e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
            trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
        
            f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
            material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
            it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
            any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
            those licensors and authors.
        
          All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
        restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
        received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
        governed by this License along with a term that is a further
        restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
        a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
        License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
        of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
        not survive such relicensing or conveying.
        
          If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
        must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
        additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
        where to find the applicable terms.
        
          Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
        form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
        the above requirements apply either way.
        
          8. Termination.
        
          You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
        provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
        modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
        this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
        paragraph of section 11).
        
          However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
        license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
        provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
        finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
        holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
        prior to 60 days after the cessation.
        
          Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
        reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
        violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
        received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
        copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
        your receipt of the notice.
        
          Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
        licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
        this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
        reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
        material under section 10.
        
          9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
        
          You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
        run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
        occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
        to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
        nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
        modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
        not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
        covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
        
          10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
        
          Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
        receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
        propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
        for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
        
          An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
        organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
        organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
        work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
        transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
        licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
        give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
        Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
        the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
        
          You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
        rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
        not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
        rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
        sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
        
          11. Patents.
        
          A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
        License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
        work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
        
          A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
        owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
        hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
        by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
        but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
        consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
        purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
        patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
        this License.
        
          Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
        make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
        propagate the contents of its contributor version.
        
          In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
        agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
        (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
        sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
        party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
        patent against the party.
        
          If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
        and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
        to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
        publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
        then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
        available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
        patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
        consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
        license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
        actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
        covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
        in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
        country that you have reason to believe are valid.
        
          If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
        arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
        covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
        receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
        or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
        you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
        work and works based on it.
        
          A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
        the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
        conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
        specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
        work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
        in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
        to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
        the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
        parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
        patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
        conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
        for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
        contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
        or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
        
          Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
        any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
        otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
        
          12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
        
          If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
        otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
        excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
        covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
        License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
        not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
        to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
        the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
        License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
        
          13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
        
          Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
        permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
        under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
        combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
        License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
        but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
        section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
        combination as such.
        
          14. Revised Versions of this License.
        
          The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
        the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
        be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
        address new problems or concerns.
        
          Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
        Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
        Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
        option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
        version or of any later version published by the Free Software
        Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
        GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
        by the Free Software Foundation.
        
          If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
        versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
        public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
        to choose that version for the Program.
        
          Later license versions may give you additional or different
        permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
        author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
        later version.
        
          15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
          THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
        HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
        THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
        IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
        ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
        
          16. Limitation of Liability.
        
          IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
        WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
        THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
        GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
        USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
        DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
        PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
        EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH DAMAGES.
        
          17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
        
          If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
        above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
        reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
        an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
        Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
        copy of the Program in return for a fee.
        
                             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
                    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
        
          If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
        possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
        free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
        
          To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
        to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
        state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
        the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
        
            <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
            Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
        
            This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
            it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
            the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
            (at your option) any later version.
        
            This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
            but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
            MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
            GNU General Public License for more details.
        
            You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
            along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
        Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
        
          If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
        notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
        
            <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
            This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
            This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
            under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
        
        The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
        parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
        might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
        
          You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
        if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
        For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
        <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
        
          The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
        into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
        may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
        the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
        Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
        <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

# TreeProfiler Overview
TreeProfiler is a command line tool designed to automate the annotation of large phylogenetic trees with corresponding metadata. It also facilitates the visual exploration of these annotations as phylogenetic profiles, making it a powerful resource for researchers working with complex biological data.

Key Features:
- Automated Annotation that integrates metadata into phylogenetic tree, and summarizes annotation in internal nodes, including:
  - Categorical/Numerical metadata in TSV/CSV format
  - Taxonomic Annotation of NCBI/GTDB taxonomy database
  - Functional Annotation from eggnog-mapper output
  - Domain annotation from pfam/smart
  - Multiple Sequence Alignment annotation
- Visual Exploration that allows for the detailed examination of annotated trees, aiding in the interpretation and presentation of data.
- Analytic Methods for computing analysis from leaf nodes:
  - Ancestral Character Reconstruction for both discrete and continuous traits.
  - Phylogenetic Signal Delta Statistic]
  - Lineage Specificity Analysis

The official documentation of TreeProfiler is in https://dengzq1234.github.io/TreeProfiler/ where  provides detailed instructions with examples.

### Manual installation
#### Install ETE v4
Quick way
```
pip install https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete/archive/ete4.zip
```
For local development
To install ETE in a local directory to help with the development, you can:

- Clone this repository (git clone https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete.git)
- Install dependecies
  - If you are using conda: `conda install -c conda-forge cython bottle brotli pyqt numpy<2.0`
  - Otherwise, you can install them with `pip install <dependencies>`
  - Build and install ete4 from the repository's root directory: `pip install -e .`

(In Linux there may be some cases where the gcc library must be installed, which can be done with `conda install -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64`)

#### Install TreeProfiler
Install dependencies
```
# install BioPython, selenium, scipy via conda
conda install -c conda-forge biopython selenium scipy matplotlib pymc aesara
# or pip
pip install biopython selenium scipy matplotlib pymc aesara webdriver_manager pyvirtualdisplay
```

Install TreeProfiler
```
# install TreeProfiler
git clone https://github.com/compgenomicslab/TreeProfiler
cd TreeProfiler/
python setup.py install
```
Or 
```
# install directly
pip install https://github.com/compgenomicslab/TreeProfiler/archive/main.zip
```

### Input files
TreeProfiler takes following file types as input 

| Input    |      Filetype  | 
|----------|-------------   |
| Tree     |      newick, ete    | 
| Metadata |      tar.gz, tsv       |

- ete format is a novel format developed to solve the situation we encounter in the previous step, annotated tree can be recover easily with all the annotated data without changing the data type. Besides, the ete format optimized the tree file size after mapped with its associated data. Hence it's very handy for programers in their own script. At this moment we can only view the ete format in treeprofiler, but we will make the ete format more universal to other phylogenetic software.
- Metadata input could be single or multiple files, either tar.gz compressed file(s) which contains multiple .tsv or plain .tsv file(s). 

### Basic Usage
TreeProfiler has two main subcommand:
 - annotate
 - plot

The first one `annotate` is used to annotate your input tree and corresponding metadata, TreeProfiler will map all the metadata into corresponding tree node. In this step, annotated tree will be generated in newick and ete format

```
treeprofiler annotate --tree tree.nw --input-type newick --metadata metadata.tsv --outdir ./
```

The second subcommand `plot` is used to visualize tree with associated metadata. By default, treeprofiler will launch an interactive session at localhost for user to explore input tree.

```
treeprofiler plot --tree tree_annotated.nw --input-type newick 
```
or

```
treeprofiler plot --tree tree_annotated.ete --input-type ete 
```



# Using TreeProfiler
In this Tutorial we will use TreeProfiler and demostrate basic usage with data in `examples/`

## Parsing Input tree
### Tree format

TreeProfiler accpept input tree in `.nw` or `.ete` by putting `--input-type {newick,ete}` flag to identify. By default, TreeProfiler will automatically detech the format of tree. The difference between `.nw` and `.ete`: 

 - `newick` format is more universal and be able to used in different other phylogenetic software although associated data of tree nodes will be considered as plain text.

 - `ete` format is a novel format developed to solve the situation we encounter in the previous step, annotated tree can be **recover easily with all the annotated data without changing the data type**. Besides, the ete format optimized the tree file size after mapped with its associated data. Hence it's very handy for programers in their own script. At this moment we can only view the ete format in treeprofiler, but we will make the ete format more universal to other phylogenetic software. **Hence using ete format in `plot` subcommand is highly reccomended**

### Tree parser
TreeProfiler provides argument `--internal {name,support}` to specify `newick` tree when it include values in internal node. `[default: support]`

| newick  |      leaves  |  internal_node value |  internal_parser 
|----------|-------------   |-------------   |-------------   |
| (A:0.5, B:0.5)Internal_C:0.5;  |  A, B| Internal_C| `name`| 
| (A:0.5, B:0.5)0.99:0.5;  |   A, B| 0.99| `support`| 

## `treeprofiler-annotate` computing phylogenetic profiles and annotation

### `annotate`, Annotate metadata into tree 
TreeProfiler `annotate` subcommand is the step that annotate input metadata to target tree. As a result, itwill generate the following output file:

1) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.nw*, newick format with annotated tree
2) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.ete*, ete format with annotated tree
3) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated_prop2type.txt*, config file where store the datatype of each annotated properties
4) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.tsv*,  metadata in tab-separated values format with annotated and summarized internal nodes information. 

In the following sub session we will describe the usage of following arguments in `annotate` step for metadata:
| Argument                                         | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-d, --metadata METADATA [METADATA ...]` | <metadata.csv> .csv, .tsv filename                                                                          |
| `-s, --metadata-sep METADATA_SEP`   | Column separator of metadata table `[default: \t]  `                                                           |
| `--data-matrix DATA_MATRIX [DATA_MATRIX ...]`      | <datamatrix.csv> .csv, .tsv. Numerical matrix data metadata table as array to tree, please do not provide column headers in this file, filename will become the property name in the tree. |
| `--no-headers`                                    | Metadata table doesn't contain columns name, namespace `col`+`index` will be assigned as the key of property such as `col1`. |
| `--duplicate`                                      | Treeprofiler will aggregate duplicated metadata to a list as a property if metadata contains duplicated row. |

#### Basic Metadata in TSV/CSV Format
TreeProfiler allows users to input metadata in tsv/csv file by setting `--metadata <filename.tsv|.csv>`  and `-s <seperator>`. By default, the first column of metadata should be names of target tree leaves and metadata should contain column names for each column of metadata.

TreeProfiler allows user to annotate more than one metadata inputs to tree such as `--metadata table1.tsv table2.tsv`.  

Check metadata
```
cd examples/basic_example0/
tree ./
./
├── boolean.tsv
├── categorical_duplicated.tsv
├── categorical.tsv
├── data.array
├── demo1.tree
├── numerical.tsv
└── show_tree_props.py

# check metadata structure
head categorical.tsv
name,categorical1
Taxa_0,A
Taxa_1,B
Taxa_2,B
Taxa_3,C

```

Run `annotate` subcommand
```
## annotate tree with more than one metadata tsv, seperated by `,`
# set the correct filename and seperator
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical.tsv \
-sep , \
-o .
```

After annotation, treeprofiler will generate annotated tree
```
ls demo1*
demo1_annotated.ete  demo1_annotated.nw  demo1_annotated.tsv  demo1_prop2type.txt  demo1.tree
```

Now we can check annotated tree
```
# show tree's properties
python show_tree_props.py demo1_annotated.nw

Target tree internal node Root contains the following properties:  
{'categorical1_counter': 'A--1||B--2||C--2', 'name': 'Root'}
Target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{'name': 'Taxa_0', 'dist': 0.190563, 'categorical1': 'A'}
```

#### Metadata TSV/CSV as a Numerical Data Matrix
treeprofiler can handle the whole tsv/csv file as one property and annotate it to related leaves, by using `--data-matrix <filename.tsv|.csv>` It must be numerical data matrix and without headers. Once annotated the property of data-matrix will be named by the filename (see example below) 

The difference between `--data-matrix` and `--metadata` is that the former sees the whole metadata file as a node property and stores the rows as an array in leaf nodes, and the latter sees each column from metadata as each single property of leaf nodes.

Using data array file `data.array` from the previous example
```
# annotated data.array file to tree
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--data-matrix data.array \
-sep , \
-o .

# data.array is stored as one property in tree node and value is stored as array
python show_tree_props.py demo1_annotated.nw
target tree internal node Root contains the following properties:  
{
'data.array_avg': '1.0244|-0.667|-1.7740000000000002|-0.8620000000000001|-0.6552', 
'data.array_max': '3.671|1.937|4.362|1.585|2.746', 
'data.array_min': '-2.591|-2.356|-4.825|-3.326|-2.479', 
'data.array_std': '2.3121192529798287|1.5156064132880938|3.524138873540599|1.9937640783202009|1.906460531980665', 
'data.array_sum': '5.122|-3.335|-8.870000000000001|-4.3100000000000005|-3.276', 
'name': 'Root'
}
target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{
'name': 'Taxa_0', 
'dist': 0.190563, 
'data.array': '-2.591|1.937|-3.898|0.447|-1.349'
}
```

#### Metadata Without Column Names
If metadata doesn’t have headers, by setting `--no-headers` to set the metadata properly, therefore treeprofiler will name each column by `col`+`<column number>` as the property key in each leaf node, such as `col1`, `col2`, etc.

example
```
# data.array doesn't have headers for each column 
head data.array
Taxa_0,-2.591,1.937,-3.898,0.447,-1.349
Taxa_1,3.366,-1.871,4.362,1.585,-2.479
Taxa_2,0,-0.098,0,-3.326,2.746
Taxa_3,3.671,-0.947,-4.509,-3.131,-2.194

# need to add --no-headers flag to tell treeprofiler
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata data.array \
-sep , \
--no-headers \
-o .

# check properties
python show_tree_props.py demo1_annotated.nw
target tree internal node Root contains the following properties:  
{'col1_avg': '1.92825', 
'col1_max': '3.671', 
'col1_min': '0.0', 
'col1_std': '3.463526916666666', 
'col1_sum': '7.713', 
'col2_avg': '-1.318', 
...}

target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{'name': 'Taxa_0', 
'dist': 0.190563, 
'col1': '-2.591', 
'col2': '1.937', 
'col3': '-3.898', 
'col4': '0.447', 
'col5': '-1.349'}
```

#### Missing Value Detection
Metadata column which fullfills one of the following criterias will be consider as missing value:

- Entirely symbolic characters. Such as `+`, `-`, `~`, `.`, etc.
- The exact strings `none`, `None`, `null`, `Null`, or `NaN`.
- An empty string (zero characters).

Missing value will replaced by string 'NaN' in the corresponding property.

#### Unmapped Tree Leaf Property Detection
If Metadata doesn't cover input tree leaf, tree leaf will be unannotated.  

#### Handling Duplicated Leaf Names in Metadata
In general, treeprofiler expects each row of metadata corresponding to one leaf, such as
```
head categorical.tsv
#name,categorical1
Taxa_0,A
Taxa_1,B
Taxa_2,B
Taxa_3,C
Taxa_4,C
```
Although treeprofiler can handle metadata with rows with duplicated leafnames such as
```
head categorical_duplicated.tsv
#name,categorical1
Taxa_0,A
Taxa_0,B
Taxa_2,B
Taxa_2,C
Taxa_3,C
Taxa_3,A
Taxa_4,C
```
In order to do so, users need to add `--duplicate` , by doing so, metadata from the same leaf will be aggregate into the same column. Such as the Taxa_0 from the above table, at the end value `A` and `B` will be both annotated to property `categorical1`(see above demo). **If not, treeprofielr will take one the first row of metadata that appear as the metadata for related leaf!**

example
```
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
-d categorical_duplicated.tsv \
-sep , \
--duplicate \
-o .

python show_tree_props.py demo1_annotated.nw
target tree internal node Root contains the following properties:  
{'categorical1_counter': 'A--2||B--2||C--3', 'name': 'Root'}
target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{'name': 'Taxa_0', 'dist': 0.190563, 'categorical1': 'A|B'}
```

#### Specifying Data Types for Metadata Columns
Although TreeProfiler can automatically detect datatype of each column, users still can determine the datatype using the following arguments using:

| Argument                                         | Description                                                                                                  |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--text-prop TEXT_PROP [TEXT_PROP ...]`            | names of columns which need to be read as categorical data         |
| `--multiple-text-prop MULTIPLE_TEXT_PROP [MULTIPLE_TEXT_PROP ...]` | names of columns which need to be read as categorical data containing more than one value and separated by `,` such as GO:0000003,GO:0000902,GO:0000904,GO:0003006 |
| `--num-prop NUM_PROP [NUM_PROP ...]`               | names of columns which need to be read as numerical data           |
| `--bool-prop BOOL_PROP [BOOL_PROP ...]`           | names of columns which need to be read as boolean data             |
| `--text-prop-idx TEXT_PROP_IDX [TEXT_PROP_IDX ...]`| 1 2 3 or [1-5] index of columns which need to be read as categorical data                                     |
| `--num-prop-idx NUM_PROP_IDX [NUM_PROP_IDX ...] `  | 1 2 3 or [1-5] index columns which need to be read as numerical data                                          |
| `--bool-prop-idx BOOL_PROP_IDX [BOOL_PROP_IDX ...]`| 1 2 3 or [1-5] index columns which need to be read as boolean data                                            |


#### Annotate Metadata to Internal Nodes
At the above example, we only mapped metadata to leaf nodes, in this example, we will also profile **internal nodes** annotation and analysis of their children nodes. Argument that in related to summary methods are:

| Argument                                                       | Applied datatype                | Description                                                                                                          | Summarized properties Internal node                                                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--num-stat {all,sum,avg,max,min,std,none}`                      | numerical data matrix           | Descriptive Statistic (average, sum, max, min, standard deviation)                                                   | `<prop name>`_avg <br> `<prop name>`_sum <br> `<prop name>`_max <br> `<prop name>`_min <br> `<prop name>`_std    |
| `--counter-stat {raw,relative,none}`                             | str <br> boolean <br> list      | Raw/Relative Counter                                                                                                 | `<prop name>`_counter                                                                                             |
| `--num-stat {all,sum,avg,max,min,std,none} `                     | float <br> int                  | Descriptive Statistic (average, sum, max, min, standard deviation)                                                   | `<prop name>`_avg <br> `<prop name>`_sum <br> `<prop name>`_max <br> `<prop name>`_min <br> `<prop name>`_std |
| `--column-summary-method COLUMN_SUMMARY_METHOD [COLUMN_SUMMARY_METHOD ...]` | all                             | Specify summary method for individual columns in the format ColumnName=Method, such as `--column-summary-method sample1=none sample2=avg random_type=relative alignment=none` |                                                                                                                   |

TreeProfiler can infer automatically the datatype of each column in your metadata, including 
- `list` (seperate by `,` )
- `string` (categorcial data)
- `numerical`(numerical data, float or integer)
- `booleans` 

Internal node will summurize children nodes information according to their datatypes.

demo tree
```
      ╭╴A
╴root╶┤
      │   ╭╴B
      ╰╴D╶┤
          ╰╴C
```

demo metadata
|  #name | text_property |  multiple_text_property  |   numerical_property  | bool_property| 
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
|A|vowel|a,b,c|10|True|
|B|consonant|b,c,d|4|False|
|C|consonant|c,d,e|9|True|

Treeprofiler will infer the datatypes of above metadata and adpot different summary method:
|  - | text_property |  multiple_text_property  |   numerical_property  | bool_property| 
|----------|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
|datatype|string|list|float|bool|
|method|counter|counter|average,sum,max,min,standard deviation|counter|

- **Categorical**

boolean and text properties (categorical data) of leaf nodes will be summarized as counters in internal nodes, currently users can choose using `raw` (default), `relative` or `none` for counter. Users can use `--counter-stat {raw,relative,none}` to choose the counter, it will automatically apply to all categorical properties.

After annotation, internal nodes will be summarized. If property was summarize with `counter`, in internal node will be named as ```<property_name>_counter```



Users can choose either counter is raw or relative count by using `--counter-stat`
| internal_node properties  |      statistic method  | 
|----------|-------------   |
| `<prop name>`_counter  |      raw(default), relative    | 

|  internal_node| text_property_counter |  multiple_text_property_counter  | bool_property_counter| 
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
|D|consonant--2|b--1\|\|c--2\|\|d--2\|\|e--1|True--1\|\|False--1|
|root|vowel--1\|\|consonant--2|a--2\|\|b--2\|\|c--3\|\|d--2\|\|e--1|True--2\|\|False--1|

Example
```
# raw counter (default)
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical.tsv \
-s , \
--counter-stat raw \
-o ./ 

python show_tree_props.py demo1_annotated.nw
target tree internal node Root contains the following properties:  
{
'categorical1_counter': 'A--1||B--2||C--2', 
'name': 'Root'
}
target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{
'name': 'Taxa_0', 
'dist': 0.190563, 
'categorical1': 'A'
}

#relative counter to calculate the percentage
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical.tsv \
-s , \
--counter-stat relative \

{
'name': 'Taxa_0', 
'dist': 0.190563, 
'categorical1': 'A'
}

#set to none
treeprofiler annotate \

{'name': 'Root'}
target tree leaf node Taxa_0 contains the following propertiies:  
{'name': 'Taxa_0', 'dist': 0.190563, 'categorical1': 'A'}
```

- **Numerical**

By default, numerical feature will be calculated all the descriptive statistic, but users can choose specific one to be calculated by using `--num-stat {all, sum, avg, max, min, std, none}`. `all` (default) means it will conduct all the statistic. `none` means annotation will only conduct in leaf nodes.

If property was numerical data, in internal node will be named as 
| internal_node properties  |      statistic method  | 
|----------|-------------   |
| `<prop name>`_avg      |      average    | 
| `<prop name>`_sum      |      sum    |

| `<prop name>`_min      |      minimum    | 
| `<prop name>`_std      |      standard deviation    | 

Noticed that `--num-stat` will also work on `--data-matrix` data. 

In our demo, it would be:
|  internal_node| numerical_property_avg |  numerical_property_sum  | numerical_property_max| numerical_property_max| numerical_property_max|

##### Customizing Summary Methods for Different Columns
Using `--column-summary-method`  can specify the summary method of each properties, simply add `<property name>=<summary method>` . For categorical data, options are `raw,relative,none`; for numerical data, options are  `all, sum, avg, max, min, std, none` . 

such as `--column-summary-method sample1=none sample2=avg random_type=relative alignment=none`

Noted that `--data-matrix` can be effected by `--column-summary-method` setting, in this case filename of the data matrix is property name, such as`--data-matrix file.tsv --column-summary-method file.tsv=avg`

example:
here we use three different metadata: categorical tsv, numerical tsv and data matrix
```
# cusomtize different summary methods for different column/property
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical.tsv numerical.tsv \
--data-matrix data.array \

--column-summary-method \

'random_column3': '43.0',
'data.array': '-2.591|1.937|-3.898|0.447|-1.349'
}
```

##### Annotate internal nodes with **Last Common Ancestor**
Most of time metadata mostly are related to the leaf annotation of tree, treeprofiler summarizes annotation from leaves and passes to internal nodes. If the internal nodes don't have name, treeprofiler will assign one based on `N` + `<int>`, for example from the previous session:


```
# treeprofiler assigns name to unname internal nodes
python show_tree_props_ancestor.py demo1_annotated.nw
Target tree internal node if Taxa_0 and Taxa_1 contains the following properties:  
{
  'name': 'N7', 
  'dist': 0.97338, 
  'categorical1_counter': 'A--0.50||B--0.50', 
  'data.array_avg': '0.38749999999999996|0.03300000000000003|0.23199999999999998|1.016|-1.9140000000000001', 
  ....
}
```

Although sometimes we hope to assign data to internal tree nodes. Therefore users can:

1) If tree has names for internal nodes, users can directly use those names in the metadata for annotations, such as
```
name,categorical1
Taxa_0,A
Taxa_1,B
Internal1,A
```

2) If tree does not have names for internal nodes, users can conduct a secondary annotation after treeprofiler assign names for internal nodes automatically, such as 
```
name,categorical1
N1,A
```

3) If tree does not have names for internal nodes, another methods is to refer the nodes using last common ancestor. Choose two leaves whose most last common ancestor is the node of interest, and provide their IDs, separated by a double vertical bar ('||'). For example in `categorical_ancestor.tsv`
```
name,categorical1
Taxa_0,A
Taxa_1,B
...
Taxa_0||Taxa_1,A
Taxa_2||Taxa_4,C
```
In this example, it refers to add annotation value `A` as proptery `categorical1` to the common ancestor of leaf nodes `Taxa_0` and `Taxa_1`. Here is the result:

```
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical_ancestor.tsv \
-s , \
-o ./

python show_tree_props_ancestor.py demo1_annotated.nw
Target tree internal node if Taxa_0 and Taxa_1 contains the following properties:  
{
  'name': 'N7', 
  'dist': 0.97338, 
  'categorical1': 'A', 
  'categorical1_counter': 'A--1||B--1'
}
```
As result, internal node `N7` as the common ancestor of `Taxa_0` and `Taxa_1`, is annotated.

### Taxonomic annotation
If input metadada containcs taxon data, TreeProfiler allows users to process taxonomic annotation with either GTDB or NCBI database.

In this part we will demostrate the usage of taxonomic annotation in examples of `examples/taxonomy_example`

```

``` 

#### Using Different Taxonomic Databases from GTDB/NCBI
To start taxonomic annotation, using `--taxon-column` and `--taxadb` to locate where is the taxon and which taxonomic databases to be used. If taxon is leaf name, then using `--taxon-column name` , otherwise `--taxon-column <prop_name>` which refers to the column in the metadata.

- NCBI examples
```
# check example tree
cat ncbi.tree
((9606, 9598), 10090);

# run taxonomic annotation and locate taxon column in leaf name

--taxon-column name \
--taxadb ncbi \

#### Identifying Taxon Names in Different Metadata Fields/Columns
When Taxon properties are embeded in different column or field in metadata, treeprofiler provides `--taxon-column`, `--taxon-delimiter` and `--taxa-field` to identify taxon term in order to process taxonomic annotation sucessfully. Here is summary of different cases with corresponding setting.

| metadata (`,` as column seperator) |taxon to be identified |       command line setting  | 
|----------|-------------   | ----|
| `#id,col1`<br>`9598,wt`     | 9598|     `--taxon-column name` | 
| `#id,col1`<br>`7739.XP_002609184.1,wt`     |   7739|   `--taxon-column name --taxon-delimiter . --taxa-field 0`   | 
| `#id,ncbi_id`<br>`leaf_A,7739`    | 7739|     `--taxon-column ncbi_id`    | 
| `#id,ncbi_id`<br>`leaf_A,7739.XP_002609184.1`     |   7739|      `--taxon-column ncbi_id --taxon-delimiter . --taxa-field 0`    | 
|`#id,col1`<br> `RS_GCF_001560035.1,wt`   | RS_GCF_001560035.1|     `--taxon-column name`   |

#### Ignoring Unclassified Taxonomic Annotations
Taxonomic annotation will annotate the internal nodes based on the taxa of leaf nodes, but if leaf node has unknown taxonomic information, the internal nodes will return unknown annotation. Using `--ignore-unclassified` to ignore the unknown annotation from leaves

```
# check tree with unknown taxa
cat missing_gtdb_v202.tree

### Functional Annotation
we use example in `examples/pratical_example/emapper`

#### Annotating Multiple Sequence Alignments
treeprofiler will can anntotate msa to tree and automatically calculate the consesus sequence in the internal node (fixed threshold 0.7), alignment will stored in nodes with property name `alignment`. Using `--column-summary-method alignment=none` can switch off the function for calculating consensus sequence for internal nodes.

```
# annotate alignment
treeprofiler annotate --tree nifH.nw --alignment nifH.faa.aln

# mute consensus sequence
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree nifH.nw \
--alignment nifH.faa.aln \
--column-summary-method alignment=none \
-o ./
```

#### Annotating EggNOG-Mapper Output and Domain information
[EggNOG-mapper](http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/), is a tool for fast functional annotation of novel sequences. It uses precomputed orthologous groups and phylogenies from the eggNOG database (http://eggnog5.embl.de) to transfer functional information from fine-grained orthologs only.

### Analytical Methods in TreeProfiler
we use examples in `examples/analytic_example`

#### Ancestral Character Reconstruction
TreeProfiler provides analytic methods for ancestral character reconstruction based on metadata to estimate the ancestral condition of phenotypic traits – usually at internal nodes. Based on different data type of metadata, discrete and contiunous. Here is all the arguments and options:

| Argument                                         | Description                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--acr-discrete-columns ACR_DISCRETE_COLUMNS [ACR_DISCRETE_COLUMNS ...]` | names of columns to perform acr analysis for discrete traits                                                       |
| `--acr-continuous-columns ACR_CONTINUOUS_COLUMNS [ACR_CONTINUOUS_COLUMNS ...]` | names of columns to perform acr analysis for continuous traits                                                       |
| `--prediction-method {MPPA,MAP,JOINT,DOWNPASS,ACCTRAN,DELTRAN,COPY,ALL,MP,ML,BAYESIAN}   `                    | Prediction method for ACR analysis.<br>For **Discrete** traits: `MPPA`, `MAP`, `JOINT`, `DOWNPASS`, `ACCTRAN`, `DELTRAN`, `COPY`, `ALL`, `ML`, `MP`.<br>For **Continuous** traits: `ML`, `BAYESIAN`. `[Default: MPPA]` |
| `--model {JC,F81,EFT,HKY,JTT,BM,OU}`                                        | Evolutionary model for ML methods in ACR analysis.For **discrete traits**: `JC`, `F81`, `EFT`, `HKY`, `JTT` For **continuous traits**: `BM`, `OU`. `[Default: F81]`           |
| `--threads THREADS `                                     | Number of threads to use for annotation. `[Default: 4]`  `  

##### ACR for discrete data
TreeProfiler has integrated [pastml](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/pastml) (https://github.com/evolbioinfo/pastml), a flexible platform for ancestral reconstruction with tree.

- `--acr-discrete-columns <PROP>`  allow users to calculate the ancestral character state construction via pastml package. Hence the internal node will be infered the state based on the children leaf node metadata.
- `--prediction-method <MPPA,MAP,JOINT,DOWNPASS,ACCTRAN,DELTRAN,COPY,ALL,MP,ML>` for user to choose prediction method. 
- `--model <JC,F81,EFT,HKY,JTT>`, for user to choose the evolutionary model for calculating the marginal propabilities using the prediction method except fo `MP`. 

It will generate the output config file from PASTML package as 
`params.character_{prop}.method_{method}.model_{model}.tab` which contains information of likelihood from different model/method.

Here is tree with example metadata which is categorical dataset:

**MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD (ML) METHODS**

ML approaches are based on probabilistic models of character evolution along tree branches. From a theoretical standpoint, ML methods have some optimality guaranty [Zhang and Nei, 1997, Gascuel and Steel, 2014], at least in the absence of model violation. Noted that running this ML method will generate output file as `marginal_probabilities.character_{prop}.model_{model}.tab` which contain the calculated propabilities of each character in every internal nodes. Instead **MP method** won’t generate it because it doesn’t compute the marginal propabilities

We provide three ML methods: maximum a posteriori (MAP), Joint, and marginal posterior probabilities approximation (MPPA, recommended):


- `MAP` (maximum a posteriori) computes the marginal posterior probabilities of every state for each of the tree nodes, based on the information from the whole tree, i.e. tip states and branch lengths (obtained via two tree traversals: bottom-up, and then top-down). MAP then chooses a state with the highest posterior probability for each node, independently from one node to another. This could induce globally inconsistent scenarios (typically: two very close nodes with incompatible predictions).

- `JOINT`
While MAP chooses predicted states based on all possible scenarios, Joint method [Pupko et al., 2000] reconstructs the states of the scenario with the highest likelihood.

- `MPPA`(default), 
MAP and Joint methods choose one state per node and do not reflect the fact that with real data and large trees, billions of scenarios may have similar posterior probabilities. Based on the marginal posterior probabilities, MPPA (marginal posterior probabilities approximation) chooses for every node a subset of likely states that minimizes the prediction error measured by the Brier score. It therefore sometimes keeps multiple state predictions per node but only when they have similar and high probabilities. Note however that the states not kept by MPPA might still be significant despite being less probable -- to check marginal probabilities of each state on a node consult the output marginal probabilities file (can be downloaded via the button below each compressed visualisation).

- `ML` 
all the ML methods for ML

**Character evolution models (only in ML methods)**

We provide some models of character evolution that differ in the way the equilibrium frequencies of states are calculated: `JC`, `F81` *(recommended)*, and `EFT` (estimate-from-tips, *not recommended*). Using `--prediction-method <model>` to set up.

- `JC`
With JC model [Jukes and Cantor, 1969] all frequencies, and therefore rates of changes from state i to state j (i ≠ j) are equal.

- `F81` (recommended)
With F81 model [Felsenstein, 1981], the rate of changes from i to j (i ≠ j) is proportional to the equilibrium frequency of j. The equilibrium frequencies are optimised.

- `EFT`
With EFT (estimate-from-tips) model, the equilibrium frequencies are calculated based on the tip state proportions, the rate of changes from i to j (i ≠ j) is proportional to the equilibrium frequency of j.

**MAXIMUM PARSIMONY (MP) METHODS**

MP methods aim to minimize the number of state changes in the tree. They are very quick but not very accurate, e.g. they do not take into account branch lengths. We provide three MP methods: `DOWNPASS`, `ACCTRAN`, and `DELTRAN`.

- `DOWNPASS`
DOWNPASS [Maddison and Maddison, 2003] performs two tree traversals: bottom-up and top-down, at the end of which it calculates the most parsimonious states of ancestral nodes based on the information from the whole tree. However some of the nodes might be not completely resolved due to multiple parsimonious solutions.

- `DELTRAN`
DELTRAN (delayed transformation) [Swofford and Maddison, 1987] reduces the number of node state ambiguities by making the changes as close to the tips as possible, hence prioritizing parallel mutations.

- `ACCTRAN`
ACCTRAN (accelerated transformation) [Farris, 1970] reduces the number of node state ambiguities by forcing the state changes to be performed as close to the root as possible, and therefore prioritises the reverse mutations.

- `MP`
all the MP methods for MP

##### ACR for contiunous data
TreeProfiler supports ancestral character reconstruction for continuous traits using two main approches: **Maximum Likelihood (ML)** and **Bayesian** infeference. Both methods rely on evolutionary models for continuous data, specifically the **Brownian Motion (BM)** and **Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU)** models.

TreeProfiler allows users to select the desired method and model using the following arguments:

- `--acr-continuous-columns <PROP>`: Specify the column names for the continuous traits.
- `--prediction-method <ML/BAYESIAN>`: Choose between the ML or Bayesian approach.
- `--model <BM/OU>`: Choose the evolutionary model for continuous trait analysis.

Here is tree with example metadata which is continuous dataset `Anolis.tre` and `svl.csv`:
```

#### Phylogenetic Signal Delta Statistic
Running signal delta statistic required running Ancestral Character Reconstruction using MPPA or MP methods in order to have the ancestral character propabilities. Calculated delta statistic metric and p_value of given trait will be stored in root node as properties with `<prop>` + suffix `_pval` and `_delta`.

### Output Formats for Annotated Trees
TreeProfiler `annotate` subcommand will generate the following output file to target directory when user use `--ourdir` or `-o`

1) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.nw*, newick format with annotated tree
2) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.ete*, ete format with annotated tree
3) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated_prop2type.txt*, config file where store the datatype of each annotated properties
4) `<input_tree>` + *_annotated.tsv*,  metadata in tab-separated values format with annotated and summarized internal nodes information. 

#### Use standard input and output formats
TreeProfiler is able receive and produce tree in standard format in order to integrate with command program.

- Standard output, use `--quiet` and `--stdout` at the same time can mute the log and output annotated tree in newick format.
```
cd basic_example0/

treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata categorical.tsv \
-s , \
--quiet \
--stdout

((Taxa_3:0.219065[&&NHX:categorical1=C],(Taxa_4:0.188681[&&NHX:categorical1=C],Taxa_2:0.5196[&&NHX:categorical1=B])0.166914:0.90365[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=B--1||C--1:name=N3])0.138062:0.0632016[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=B--1||C--2:name=N4],(Taxa_0:0.190563[&&NHX:categorical1=A],Taxa_1:0.458423[&&NHX:categorical1=B])0.138062:0.97338[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=A--1||B--1:name=N7])[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=A--1||B--2||C--2:name=Root];
```

- Standard input, use `-` as input in `--tree` argument to take standard input into account.

```
cd basic_example0/

cat demo1.tree|treeprofiler annotate -t - --metadata categorical.tsv -s , --quiet --stdout

((Taxa_3:0.219065[&&NHX:categorical1=C],(Taxa_4:0.188681[&&NHX:categorical1=C],Taxa_2:0.5196[&&NHX:categorical1=B])0.166914:0.90365[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=B--1||C--1:name=N3])0.138062:0.0632016[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=B--1||C--2:name=N4],(Taxa_0:0.190563[&&NHX:categorical1=A],Taxa_1:0.458423[&&NHX:categorical1=B])0.138062:0.97338[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=A--1||B--1:name=N7])[&&NHX:categorical1_counter=A--1||B--2||C--2:name=Root];
```

In the following `plot` step, users can use either `.nw` or `.ete` by putting `--input-type [newick, ete]` flag to identify. The difference between `.nw` and `.ete` format is 

 - newick file is more universal and be able to used in different other phylogenetic software although associated data of tree nodes will be considered as plain text, so if you use newick format, alongside with the prop2type config file which was generated before by adding `--prop2type <prop2type_file>`

 - ete format is a novel format developed to solve the situation we encounter in the previous step, annotated tree can be **recover easily with all the annotated data without changing the data type**. Besides, the ete format optimized the tree file size after mapped with its associated data. Hence it's very handy for programers in their own script. At this moment we can only view the ete format in treeprofiler, but we will make the ete format more universal to other phylogenetic software. **Hence using .ete format in `plot` subcommand is highly reccomended**


## treeprofiler-plot visualizing phylogenetic profiles and annotation
TreeProfiler provides a several of layout options for visualize features in metadata along with tree, depends on their datatype


### Interactive visualization interface
TreeProfiler uses the new visualization framework implemented in [ETE 4.0](https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete/tree/ete4), which allows for the interactive exploration of huge phylogenies based on a context-based adaptive zooming strategy.

we use example from `examples/basic_example1` , which contain all kind of datatype

![treeprofiler interface](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/control_panel-0002.png?raw=true)

Overview of the TreeProfiler visualization interface. (A) The control panel allows users to customize visualization layout and features, and to perform text-based searches. (B) An annotated example tree, from `examples/basic_example1/` after `annotate`, is launched with a command `plot`. Support values (red) and branch distance (grey) are displayed on top of branches. The properties of one of the nodes are shown on the top. The minimap (bottom right) facilitates navigation. (C) The node editor panel provides access to node-specific actions, such as creating subtrees, collapsing, pruning, rooting and more. (D) Visualized properties by order are, categorical data `random_type` in `rectangle-layout`, numerical data `sample1`, `sample2`, `sample3` in `heatmap-layout` and `sample4`, `sample5` in `barplot-layout`, categorical data `random-type` in `profiling-layout` shown as presence-absence matrix. Layouts are shown with the order as input argument order from the command line. Names of properties are shown as titles on the top of each layout. (E) Legends each layout is shown on the top right corner with the same order as the layouts.
  

### Basic options of visualizing layouts
Selected properties of tree will be visualized at the aligned panel alongside with the tree, here is some basic parameters for layouts.
| Argument            | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Layouts for categorical data
Users can add the following flag to activate layouts for categorical data
| Argument                                             | Description                                                                  | Leaf node                                     | Internal node                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `--label-layout LABEL_LAYOUT [LABEL_LAYOUT ...]`      | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where values will be displayed on the aligned panel. | TextFace                                     | Stacked Horizontal RecFace (only collapsed) |
| `--rectangle-layout RECTANGLE_LAYOUT [RECTANGLE_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where values will be labeled as rectangular color blocks on the aligned panel. | RecFace                                      | Stacked Horizontal RecFace (only collapsed) |
| `--colorbranch-layout COLORBRANCH_LAYOUT [COLORBRANCH_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where branches will be colored based on different values. | Branch with color                            | Stacked Horizontal RecFace (only collapsed) |
| `--bubble-layout BUBBLE_LAYOUT [BUBBLE_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where nodes will be colored based on different bubble. | Circles with color                            | None |
| `--background-layout BACKGROUND_LAYOUT [BACKGROUND_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where values will be labeled as rectangular color blocks on the aligned panel. | Background with color                        | Stacked Horizontal RecFace (only collapsed) |

#### Label Layout
`--label-layout` will display the values of the given properties on the aligned panel. It will be shown as `TextFace` on leaf nodes and `Stacked Horizontal RecFace` on internal nodes.

```bash
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--label-layout random_type
```

![label_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_label_layout.jpeg?raw=true)

`--label-layout` displays the corresponding value of selected property
of each leaf and categorized with colors. 

#### Rectangle Layout
`--rectangle-layout` will assign a color to each variable under the property, displaying as colored rectangle in aligned panel, when internal branches collapsed,  aligned panel shows the horizontal stacked bar to demostrate the composition of each variable.

```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--rectangle-layout random_type
```
![rectangle_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_rectangular_layout.jpeg?raw=true)

`--rectangle-layout` categorizes values of selected property by displaying rectangular color block alongside the corresponing leaf node.

#### ColorBranch Layout
`--colorbranch-layout`  will assign a color to each variable under the property, displaying as colored branch of corresponding node.

Noted that in this case from leaf to root, if node contains the given property, it will still have the colored branch.

```
# every node share the property "name"
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--colorbranch-layout name
```

![colorbranch_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_colorbranch_layout_name.png?raw=true)

If internal node doesn’t have the given property, once it collapsed, aligned panel shows the horizontal stacked bar to demostrate the composition of each variable.
```
# show normal counter
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--colorbranch-layout random_type
```
![colorbranch_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_colorbranch_layout_random.png?raw=true)
`colorbranch-layout` categorize values of selected property by coloring the leaf nodes.

#### Bubble Layout
`--bubble-layout` categorizes values of selected property by displaying color bubble on the corresponing leaf node.

```
# show normal counter
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--bubble-layout random_type
```
![bubble_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_bubble_layout_randomtype.png?raw=true)

#### Background Layout
`--background-layout` works just like `--colorbranch-layout`, the only difference is `--background-layout` visualize the background of the corresponding node instead of the branch color. It is useful and more visual when the tree is large.
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--background-layout random_type
```
![background_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_background_layout.png?raw=true)

#### Piechart Layout
`--piechart-layout` is unique layout designed for visualize internal nodes which contain counter of the given property from children nodes.

```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--piechart-layout random_type
```

![piechart_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_piechart_layout.png?raw=true)

#### Profiling Layout
`--profiling-layout` will convert categorical trait regardless `str` or `list` into presence-absence matrix. Importantly, once it collapsed, aligned matrix will show the gradient of presence/total of corresponding trait. This layout using draw_array algorithm from ete4 therefore it is s suitable for large scale.

single value example:
```
# check metadata
awk '{print $1,$7}' basic_example1_metadata1.tsv|head
#name random_type
Phy003I7ZJ_CHICK medium
Phy0054BO3_MELGA medium
Phy00508FR_NIPNI low
Phy004O1E0_APTFO medium

--profiling-layout list_data
```
![profiling_layout example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_profiling_layout_list.png?raw=true)

#### Categorical Matrix Layout¶
`--categorical-matrix-layout` is similar to `--rectangle-layout`, which shows color block to represent the variable. But `--rectangle-layout` take EACH given column as one individual case as one layout, --categorical-matrix-layout take ALL given columns as one case to one layout.

In this example we use `MCC_FluA_H3.tree`, time-scaled phylogenetic tree of H3 influenza viruses inferred by BEAST using molecular clock model and `MCC_FluA_H3_Genotype.txt`, Genotype table of the H3 influenza viruses([Yu, Guangchuang et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.v15v0)). 8 gene segments `PB2`,`PB1`,`PA`,`HA`,`NP`,`NA`,`M`,`NS` as properties, and virus strain `trig`, `pdm` and `HuH3N2` are categorized with different colors in the matrix.

### Layouts for boolean data
Users can add the following flag to activate layouts for Boolean data

| Argument                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                        | Leaf node                        | Internal node                         |

### Layouts for Numerical data
Users can add the following flag to activate layouts for Numerical data

| Argument                                              | Description                                                                                                                  | Applied on data-matrix (file)? | Applied on negative data? |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `--colorbranch-layout COLORBRANCH_LAYOUT [COLORBRANCH_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties where branches will be colored based on different values.                               | no                             | yes                       |
| `--bubble-layout BUBBLE_LAYOUT [BUBBLE_LAYOUT ...]`   | (experimental) `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties that need to be plotted as bubble-layout.                                | no                             | yes                       |
| `--heatmap-layout HEATMAP_LAYOUT [HEATMAP_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of numerical properties that need to be read as heatmap-layout.                                       | no                             | yes                       |
| `--heatmap-mean-layout HEATMAP_MEAN_LAYOUT [HEATMAP_MEAN_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of numerical properties that need to be read as heatmap-layout.                                       | no                             | yes                       |

| `--barplot-scale <prop1>`                             | Using certain prop as the barplot scale for all of the barplot. `[default: None]`.                                            |                                |                           |
| `--numerical-matrix-layout NUMERICAL_MATRIX_LAYOUT [NUMERICAL_MATRIX_LAYOUT ...]` | Numerical matrix that takes into account ALL values into gradient from white to red. `<prop1> <prop2>` names which need to be plotted as numerical_matrix_layout for numerical values. | yes                            | yes                       |

#### Heatmap Layout
A series of heatmap layout is only the matter how to normalize the value to show the gradient of color.

- `--heatmap-layout` values will be normalized between 0 and 1 (minimum, maximum).

- `--heatmap-mean-layout` values will be normalized between -1 and 1 by using the formula (val-mean)/(max-min)

- `--heatmap-zscore-layout` values will be Z-score normalized by using the formula (val-mean)/std.

`--heatmap-layout` Examples:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5
```
![heatmap example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_heatmap_layout1.png?raw=true)

`--heatmap-mean-layout` Examples:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-mean-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5
```
![heatmap example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_heatmap_layout2.png?raw=true)

`--heatmap-zscore-layout` Examples:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-zscore-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5
```
![heatmap example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_heatmap_layout3.png?raw=true)


#### Barplot Layout
- `--barplot-layout` will show the value as barplot, the length of barplot is the value of the property. will show barplot of numerical color. Noted that negative value won’t show in barplot

- `--barplot-width` is the parameter to set the length of barplot, default is `200px`.

- `--barplot-scale` is the parameter to set the scale of barplot, if not given, the scale will be the maximum value of the property.

- `--barplot-colorby` set the color of barplot by the a categorical property from metadata.[default: None]

```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--barplot-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5
```
![barplot example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_barplot_layout1.png?raw=true)

Using `--barplot-width` and `--barplot-scale` can help with different setting of barplot.

`--barplot-scale` can use one certain prop to set the scale of all barplot in order to facilitate the cross column comparison.

```
# two different columns with differen value in same scale, but change the width of barplot
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--barplot-width 100 \
--barplot-layout abs_data abs_data2

# two different columns using column "abs_data" as scale to cross compare with "abs_data2"
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--barplot-layout abs_data abs_data2 \
--barplot-scale abs_data
```

![barplot example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_barplot_layout2.png?raw=true)

![barplot example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_barplot_layout3.png?raw=true)

Noticed barplot in general is filled with one color for each column, using `--barplot-colorby` allows users to fill barplot based on other categorical data.

here we color barplot `abs_data` by the categorical data `random_type`
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--barplot-layout abs_data \
--barplot-colorby random_type
```
![barplot example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_barplot_layout4.png?raw=true)

#### Numerical Matrix Layout¶
`--numerical-matrix-layout` is similar to `--heatmap-layout`but using draw_array from ete4 therefore it is suitable for large scale, and also visualize data matrix which was stored as a file in previous annotation step.. But the limit is only work on rectangular tree.

Here we example from `examples/basic_example0`:
```
head data.array
Taxa_0,-2.591,1.937,-3.898,0.447,-1.349
Taxa_1,3.366,-1.871,4.362,1.585,-2.479
Taxa_2,0,-0.098,0,-3.326,2.746
Taxa_3,3.671,-0.947,-4.509,-3.131,-2.194
Taxa_4,0.676,-2.356,-4.825,0.115,0

#Annotate data.array column by column
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--metadata data.array \
--no-headers \
-s , \
-o ./

# visualize each column using numerical matrix
treeprofiler plot \
-t demo1_annotated.ete \
--numerical-matrix-layout col1 col2 col3 col4 col5

# Or annotate data.array as a data matrix file
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--data-matrix data.array \
-s , \
-o ./

# now data.array is a property
treeprofiler plot \
-t demo1_annotated.ete \
--numerical-matrix-layout data.array
```

### Layouts for Analytical Data
Users can add the following arguments to use layouts for Analytical data


| Argument                                           | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--acr-discrete-layout ACR_DISCRETE_LAYOUT [ACR_DISCRETE_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties that need to be plotted as acr-discrete-layout. |
| `--acr-continuous-layout ACR_CONTINUOUS_LAYOUT [ACR_CONTINUOUS_LAYOUT ...]` | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties that need to be plotted as acr-continuous-layout. |
| `--ls-layout LS_LAYOUT [LS_LAYOUT ...]`            | `<prop1> <prop2>` names of properties that need to be plotted as ls-layout.   |

We use example from `examples/analytic_example`:

ACR for discrete traits:
```
# start ACR computing for Country trait and Lineage-Specificity analysis for is_Albania and is_Greece traits
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree Albanian.tree.152tax.nwk \
--internal name \
--metadata metadata_tab_ls.csv \
--acr-discrete-columns Country \
--delta-stats \
--ls-columns is_Albania is_Greece \
--prec-cutoff 0.7 \
--sens-cutoff 0.7 \
--threads 4 \
-o ./
```

#### Ancestral Character Reconstruction and Phylogenetic Signal Layout
`--acr-discrete-layout` is the layout designed for visualizing annotated tree of acr from previous annotate step or manual annotation. Noted that if phylogenetic signal test `--delta-stats` was executed, delta stat metric and p_value will be showed next to the root node.

The infered character of each internal node will be shown as colorbranch, including the uncertain character

We use example from `examples/analytic_example`:
```
# Visualize ACR annotation
treeprofiler plot \
-t Albanian.tree.152tax_annotated.ete \
--acr-discrete-layout Country
```

![acr_discrete example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_acr_layout.png?raw=true)

#### Ancestral Character Reconstruction for continuous traits

Computing ACR for continuous traits:
```
treeprofiler annotate \
-t Anolis.tre \
--metadata svl.csv \
-s , \
--acr-continuous-columns svl \
--prediction-method BAYESIAN \
--model OU \
--num-stat none \
-o ./


treeprofiler plot \
-t Anolis_annotated.ete \
--acr-continuous-layout svl
```
![acr_continuous example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_acr_continuous_layout.png?raw=true)

leaf nodes are color based on metadata `svl` with gradient, and internal branches are colored based on estimated internal trait `svl` with gradient.

#### Lineage Specificity Layout
`--ls-layout` is used to visualized the output tree which was executed with --ls-columns in previous annotate step. Noted that Lineage Specificity Calculation computes three metric, which is:

- `_f1`: f1 score

- `_prec`: trait percision

- `_sens`: trati sensitivity

Therefore the visulization will generate three layouts for each metrix shown in colorbranch with the score, plus highlighting the clade as lineage specific clade of given trait which passed the `--prec-cutoff` and `--sens-cutoff` in previous step.

```
treeprofiler plot \
-t Albanian.tree.152tax_annotated.ete \
--ls-layout is_Albania is_Greece
```

### Layouts for multiple sequence alignment
In order to visualize multiple sequence alignment alongside with the tree, first we need to annotate alignment using `--alignment` in `annotate`. Then activate alignment layout by adding `--alignment-layout` 

In the previous Functional annotation session we already annotated the tree with multiple sequence alignment, here we will show how to visualize the annotated tree with multiple sequence alignment in `examples/pratical_example/emapper`.
```
# Visualize the tree with multiple sequence alignment
treeprofiler plot \
--tree nifH_annotated.ete \
--alignment-layout
```

![alignment example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_msa_layout.png?raw=true)
`--alignment-layout` displays multiple sequence alignments with a tree. Whole MSA sequences were visualized with a tree in rectangular layout. Sacle of sequence with position roadmark located at the top.

### Layouts for eggnog-mapper pfam annotations
if metadata is pfam annotations from eggnog-mapper, using `--emapper-pfam` to annotate domain information in target tree and **MUST** be with the alignment using `--alignment` to attach corresponding file.

In order to visualize eggnog-mapper pfam/smart annotations alongside with the tree, first we need to annotate alignment using `--emapper-annotations <annotations>` in annotate. Then activate alignment layout by adding `--emapper-layout`.

Once tree is annotated, using `--domain-layout` to visualize it.

We use example in `examples/pratical_example/emapper`:

```
# Visualize the tree with eggnog-mapper pfam/smart annotations
treeprofiler plot \
--tree nifH_annotated.ete \
--domain-layout
```

![pfam example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_domain_layout.jpeg?raw=true)
`domain-layout` displays domain annotation with a tree. It requires sequence infomration `--alignment` in `annotate` step from MSA sequences to locate domain start and end position. 

### Layouts for eggnog-mapper annotations
If metadata is output from eggnog-mapper, using `--emapper-annotations` automatically parse all information as metadata. Program will parse data of all the columns from emapper output. Once tree is annotated, using `--emapper-layout` to visualize tree with all the metadata

```
seed_ortholog	evalue	score	eggNOG_OGs	max_annot_lvl	COG_category	Description	Preferred_name	GOs	EC	KEGG_ko	KEGG_Pathway	KEGG_Module	KEGG_Reaction	KEGG_rclass	BRITE	KEGG_TC	CAZy	BiGG_Reaction	PFAMs
```

We use example in `examples/pratical_example/emapper`:
```
# Visualize the tree with eggnog-mapper functional annotations
treeprofiler plot \
--tree nifH_annotated.ete \
--emapper-layout \
--column-width 70
```
General metadata from emapper annotation
![eggnogmapper example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_emapper_layout1.png?raw=true)

Functional profiling (kegg, ko, gos, etc), collapsed internal nodes shown gradient of presence/total percentage.

![eggnogmapper example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_emapper_layout3.png?raw=true)

### Layouts for Taxonomic annotation
If target tree was annotated with `--taxon-column` in previous annotate step successfully, now activate Taxonomic layout using the following arguments to visualize taxonomic classification. All rank levels will be generated separately and users can switch each of them on/off.

| Argument                     | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--taxonclade-layout`         | Activate taxonclade-layout where clades will be colored based on the taxonomy of each node.                                 |
| `--taxonrectangle-layout`     | Activate taxonrectangle-layout where the taxonomy of each node will be displayed as rectangular blocks in the aligned panel. |
| `--taxoncollapse-layout`      | Activate taxoncollapse-layout where the taxonomy of each node will be displayed as rectangular blocks in the aligned panel, and nodes will be automatically collapsed. |

Only tree which was conducted with taxonomic annotation from treeprofiler in previous annotate step can use the taxonomic visualization.

#### TaxonClade Layout
`--taxonclade-layout` will assign different color to each taxa from each rank. Each rank will be a individual layout.

we use example in `examples/taxonomy_example`:
```
# Visualize the pre-annotated example archaea tree with taxonomic classification
treeprofiler plot \
--tree archaea_annotated.nw \
--taxonclade-layout
```
![taxonclade example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_taxa_layout1.png?raw=true)

#### TaxonRectangle Layout
`--taxonrectangle-layout` shows taxonomic classification as rectangular block from root to leaf.

we use example in `examples/taxonomy_example`:
```
# Visualize the pre-annotated example archaea tree with taxonomic classification
treeprofiler plot \
--tree archaea_annotated.nw \
--taxonrectangle-layout
```
![taxonrectangle example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_taxa_layout2.png?raw=true)

#### TaxonCollapse Layout
`--taxoncollapse-layout` is similar to `--taxonrectangle-layout`, but it only show commen ancestor on one column in aligned panel which is shown as corresponding taxa from the rank. Users can switch which layout of rank to be visualized in control panel, once layout of rank is activated, tree will be collapsed based on the according rank. It is more accurate than `--taxonrectangle-layout` because it also shown the representative taxa in corresponding rank.

we use example in `examples/taxonomy_example`:
```
# Visualize the pre-annotated example archaea tree with taxonomic classification
treeprofiler plot \
--tree archaea_annotated.nw \
--taxoncollapse-layout
```
Collapse at phylumn level:
![taxonrectangle example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_taxa_layout3.png?raw=true)

Collapse at order level:
![taxonrectangle example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_taxa_layout4.png?raw=true)

### Customize color in layout with color config
treeprofiler provides the option to cusomize the color on layouts:

| CONDITION   | Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., `COLOR_MIN`, `COLOR_MAX`, `COLOR_MID`, `BARPLOT_COLORBY`) |

#### Basic setting

Here we will use the example from `examples/custom_color `, where the tree `basic_example1.nw` is annotated with `basic_example1_metadata1.tsv` and `basic_example1_metadata2.tsv`. Therefore the output tree is `basic_example1_annotated.ete` and `basic_example1_annotated.nw`.

Check metadata
```
head -5 basic_example1_metadata1.tsv basic_example1_metadata2.tsv
==> basic_example1_metadata1.tsv <==
#name       sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 random_type     bool_type       bool_type2
Phy003I7ZJ_CHICK    0.05    0.12    0.86    0.01    0.69    medium  1       TRUE
Phy0054BO3_MELGA    0.64    0.67    0.51    0.29    0.14    medium  1       TRUE
Phy00508FR_NIPNI    0.89    0.38    0.97    0.49    0.26    low     1       FALSE
Phy004O1E0_APTFO    0.1     0.09    0.38    0.31    0.41    medium  0       TRUE


==> basic_example1_metadata2.tsv <==
#name       abs_data        list_data       abs_data2

Phy00508FR_NIPNI    87      z,f,p   122
Phy004O1E0_APTFO    6       z,t,b   138
```

#### Customize color for categorical data
Column `random_type` from the metadata is annotated as categorical data property called `random_type` in result tree basic_example1_annotated.nw. By default, all variables in col6 are: `high`, `medium` and `low`, so let’s customize the in `color.categorical.config` file:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION
# tab-limited or comman-limited

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
random_type,high,red,
random_type,medium,blue,
random_type,low,#008000,
```
here we can apply this color config to all the layouts for categorical data, for example:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--rectangle-layout random_type \
--label-layout random_type \
--background-layout random_type \
--colorbranch-layout random_type \
--piechart-layout random_type \
--color-config color.categorical.config \
-s ,
```
Now all the layout will be colored based on the color config file.
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config1.png?raw=true)

**Noted that if the value is not in the color config file, the default color black will be used.**

Missing `low` value in the color config file:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION
# tab-limited or comman-limited

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
random_type,high,red,
random_type,medium,blue,
```

rerun the command:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--rectangle-layout random_type \
--label-layout random_type \
--background-layout random_type \
--colorbranch-layout random_type \
--piechart-layout random_type \
--color-config color.categorical.config \
-s ,
```

![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config2.png?raw=true)

#### Customize color for boolean data
Column `bool_type` and `bool_type2` are boolean data, therefore users can only decide the color representing True value. We stored the following config in `color.boolean.config`

```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION
# tab-limited or comman-limited

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
bool_type,1,blue,
bool_type2,TRUE,yellow,
```

Now we appiled them to the layouts for boolean data:
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--binary-layout bool_type bool_type2 \
--color-config color.boolean.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config3.png?raw=true)

#### Customize color for numerical data
We applied the color config to layouts for numerical data in `color.numerical.config`.

We can still customize certain color for specific value.

For example, we want to make make the heatmap layout with yellow color when value is `0`:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID, COLOR_NAN)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
sample1,0,yellow,
sample2,0,yellow,
sample3,0,yellow,
sample4,0,yellow,
sample5,0,yellow,
```
Then we run it on heatmap layout:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.numerical.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config4.png?raw=true)

Similar on numerical matrix:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--numerical-matrix-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.numerical.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config5.png?raw=true)

#### Advanced Setting
In the Basic setting, we only set the color for specific value, but in the Advanced setting, we can set the color for the range of value.

#### Setting color range for numerical data
We can set the color range using `COLOR_MIN`, `COLOR_MAX`, `COLOR_MID` or `COLOR_NAN` under the column `CONDITION`.

Here we set the color for the range of value in `color.numerical2.config`, noted that now the VALUE column is empty therefore the maximum value will be assigned to `COLOR_MAX`, the minimum value will be assigned to `COLOR_MIN`, and the middle value will be assigned to `COLOR_MID`:

```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
sample1,,red,COLOR_MAX
sample1,,green,COLOR_MID
sample1,,blue,COLOR_MIN
```

we run it on heatmap layout:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.numerical2.config \
-s ,
```
As you see, the color is assigned based on the range of value of property `sample1`:
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config6.png?raw=true)

#### Combining settings of value and color range for numerical data
In the previous example, we set the color range for the values, the value range is the range of minimum and maximum value by default, but we can also cusomize the value together with the color conditions

Here we set the color for the range of value in `color.numerical3.config`, noted that now the `VALUE` column is not empty as we set the range from -5 to 5, therefore the value will be assigned to the corresponding color:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
sample1,5,red,COLOR_MAX
sample1,0,green,COLOR_MID
sample1,-5,blue,COLOR_MIN
```
Then we run it on heatmap-layout:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.numerical3.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config7.png?raw=true)

If we only want to set the range of value without customize the color, is also possible:

Here we want to set up the range from -5 to 5, but we only set them as `CONDITION` without setting specific color in `COLOR` column:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
sample1,5,,COLOR_MAX
sample1,0,,COLOR_MID
sample1,-5,,COLOR_MIN
```
Rerun:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.numerical3.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config8.png?raw=true)

#### Wildcard settings of color range for numerical matrix
In the session of Layouts for numerical data, we describe the difference between `--heatmap-layout` and `--numerical-matrix-layout`. In short, `--heatmap-layout` treat each property individually therefore the range each column of heatmap is different, but `--numerical-matrix-layout` treat the whole matrix as a single property, therefore the range of value is the same for all columns.

Therefore, when we set the color config for the numerical matrix layout, we can use the wildcard * to represent all the columns in the matrix.

Here we set the color for the range of value in `color.datamatrix.config`, noted that now the PROP column is * which means all the columns in the matrix, therefore the value will be assigned to the corresponding color:
```
# TreeProfiler Color Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: Special case for numerical values (optional, e.g., COLOR_MIN, COLOR_MAX, COLOR_MID)

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
*,5,red,COLOR_MAX
*,0,white,COLOR_MID
*,-5,blue,COLOR_MIN
```

now we run it on numerical-matrix-layout:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--numerical-matrix-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--color-config color.datamatrix.config \
-s ,
```
![colorconfig1 example](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_color_config9.png?raw=true)

It applied in also for data matrix properties:

Here we annotate and plot the `data_2col.array`(a data matrix file) to demo tree `demo1.tree`:
```
treeprofiler annotate \
-t demo1.tree \
--data-matrix data_2col.array \
-s , \
-o ./

treeprofiler plot \
-t demo1_annotated.ete \
--numerical-matrix-layout data_2col.array \
--color-config color.datamatrix.config \
-s ,
```

In this session we will use examples in `examples/automatic_query`

#### Basic Query
|                | Left Value                                                                                                                                  | Operator                                                                                                        | Right Value                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Description    | This is the property of either a leaf node or an internal node within the tree. It could be any metadata feature linked to the node, such as its taxonomic classification, gene expression levels, or other biological markers. For example, `name`, `sci_name`, `support`. | This part of the query specifies the relationship between the left and right values. Operators include: `=`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, and `contains`. | This is the custom criterion against which the left value is compared. Depending on the nature of the left value, this could be a numerical figure, a string, or even a list of values. |

##### Conditional pruning
Conditional pruning, prune leaf node whose name contain “FALPE”:
```
## annotate tree
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree basic_example1.nw \
--metadata ./basic_example1_metadata1.tsv \
--counter-stat relative \
-o ./

# Conditional pruning, prune leaf node whose name contain "FALPE"
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.nw \
--pruned-by "name contains FALPE"
```
Left panel is tree before prune, right panel is result after prune
![pruned](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/prune.png?raw=true)

##### Conditional highlight
```
## annotate tree
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree basic_example1.nw \
--metadata ./basic_example1_metadata1.tsv \
--counter-stat relative \
-o ./

# select tree node whose name contains `FALPE` character
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.nw \
--input-type newick \
--highlighted-by "name contains FALPE"
```
![highlighted](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/highlighted.jpeg?raw=true)

The same annotated tree, but select tree node whose sample1 feature > 0.50, here we using ete format which can resume the datatype:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--highlighted-by "sample1 > 0.50" \
--heatmap-layout sample1
```

if use tree in newick format, we need to attach the prop2type file which can resume the datatype:
```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.nw \
--input-type newick \
--prop2type basic_example1_prop2type.txt \
--highlighted-by "sample1 > 0.50" \
--heatmap-layout sample1
```
![highlighted_numeric](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/highlighted_numeric.png?raw=true)

#### Query in internal nodes
Query in internal nodes' properties is also available, in this case, `left_value` of query will be the internal node property, remember to add the proper suffixes such as `_avg`, `_max`,etc, for the numerical data or `_counter` for categorical and boolean data. 

Example
```
# select tree internal node where sample1_avg feature < 0.50
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--collapsed-by "sample1_avg < 0.50" \
--heatmap-layout sample1
```
![collapsed_numeric](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/collapsed_numeric.png?raw=true)
Syntax for internal node counter data
```
# collapse tree internal nodes, where `high` relative counter > 0.35 in random_type_counter property
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--rectangle-layout random_type \
--collapsed-by "random_type_counter:high > 0.35" \
--column-width 70
```
![collapsed_counter](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/collapsed_counter.png?raw=true)
#### AND and OR conditions
The syntax for the AND condition and OR condition in TreeProfiler is:

AND condition will be under one argument, syntax seperated by `,`, such as 
```
# select tree  node where sample1 feature > 0.50 AND sample2 < 0.2
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--highlighted-by "sample1>0.50,sample2<0.2"
```
![highlighted_and](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/highlighted_and.png?raw=true)
OR condition will be used more than one arguments
```
# select tree node where sample1 feature > 0.50 OR sample2 < 0.2
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--highlighted-by "sample1>0.50" \
--highlighted-by "sample2<0.2"
```
![highlighted_or](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/highlighted_or.png?raw=true)

#### Conditional query with config file
In conditinary query, it also accept to use config to customize the highlighted and collapsed visualization. Example config file in `color.config.template`. It has the same structure as color config but the CONDITION column here is for operators as we mentioned in previous session.
```
cat color.config.template`
# TreeProfiler Conditional query Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: operator

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
```  

##### Highlight with custom config
we use example of `basic_example1.nw` and `basic_example1_metadata1.tsv`, we hope to highlight nodes whose `random_type` is `low` AND `sample1` greater than `0.50`, and we want to highlight those nodes in red. 

First we customize the config `color.config.query`:
```
# TreeProfiler Conditional query Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: operator

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
random_type,low,red,=
sample1,0.50,red,>
```

we attach the config using the same `--highlighted-by`, dont forget about the `-s` to indicate the seperator
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--highlighted-by color.config.query \
-s ,
```
![highlighted_or](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_query_config1.png?raw=true)

##### Collapse with custom config
Similar to `--highlighted-by`, in this case we try to collapse the internal nodes whose average of leaf properties `sample1` greater than `0.50`, with color of green. 

The config is in `color.config.collapsed`
```
# TreeProfiler Conditional query Configuration
# This file defines custom colors for properties of annotated tree nodes.
# Columns: PROP, VALUE, COLOR, CONDITION

# PROP: Property of the annotated tree node
# VALUE: Value of the property to be colored
# COLOR: Color to apply
# CONDITION: operator

PROP,VALUE,COLOR,CONDITION
#random_type_counter:high,0.35,red,>
sample1_avg,0.50,green,>
```

example run
```
treeprofiler plot \
-t basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--collapsed-by color.config.collapsed \
-s ,
```
![highlighted_or](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_query_config2.png?raw=true)

### Conditional limit based on taxonomic level¶
Prune taxonomic annotated tree based on following taxonomic rank level,
`kingdom`, `phylum`, `class`, `order`, `family`, `genus`, `species`, `subspecies` 

case in GTDB in `examples/taxonomy_example/`:
```
# Case in GTDB
# before pruning
treeprofiler plot \
--tree archaea_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--taxonclade-layout

After rank_limit
![gtdb_class](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/plot_taxaprune2.png?raw=true)
As you see, class branches of target gtdb tree are all pruned and only left the internal branches which rank as class.  

#### Choose the metric for internal nodes in numerical layout
Internal nodes of numerical data are process descriptive statistic analysis by default, hence when users collapse any branch, `--barplot_layout` or `--heatmap_layout` will demonstrate representative value, avg by default. Representative value can be changed by using `--internal-plot-measure`.

```
cd examples/basic_example1/
# select max instead of avg as internal node plotting representative
treeprofiler plot \
--tree basic_example1_annotated.ete \
--heatmap-layout sample1 sample2 sample3 sample4 sample5 \
--internal-plot-measure max
```

## Demo1 Explore GTDB taxonomic tree with metadata and habitat information of progenome3
To illustrate the easiness and flexibility of TreeProfiler, we use it to annotate and visualize the version 202 of the GTDB prokaryotic phylogeny, which represents a species tree with 60,000 representative bacterial and archaeal species in [here](https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release202/). GTDB provides the tree in plain newick format and massive datatable with various associated to such species. Apart from the metadata provided by the GTDB, here we also include annotations of genomes and species clusters to habitats from proGenomes3([Fullam et al. 2023](https://progenomes.embl.de/)). 

Example can be found in directory `./examples/pratical/gtdb_r202/`. We already prepared the gtdb v202 taxonomic tree `gtdbv202.nw` by merging Bacteria and Archaea trees, detailed steps are included in `merge_gtdbtree.py`. Based on the difference of computational capacity, complete steps and pipeline can be found in `gtdbv202full_demo.sh` and `gtdbv202lite_demo.sh`. 

1) A glance of habitat information of progenome3
```
cd examples/pratical/gtdb_r202/

zcat progenome3.tar.gz|head -n 4
progenome3.tsv0000664000175000017500000343216414447266674012351 0ustar  dengdenggtdb_genome_representative	aquatic_habitat	host_associated	soil_habitat

GB_GCA_014116815.1			
RS_GCF_000730245.1	f	t	f

```

2) Download metadata of archaea and bacteria from gtdb
```
wget https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release202/202.0/ar122_metadata_r202.tar.gz
wget https://data.gtdb.ecogenomic.org/releases/release202/202.0/bac120_metadata_r202.tar.gz
```

3) GTDB metadata annotation

Considering the size of GTDB metadata and phylogeney, here we provide two pipelines for user to choose base on their computational resources. 

- GTDB partial annotation (lightweight), which we will extract only a few of columns from metadata for annotation

```
# Extract genome_size, protein_count, gc_percentage, ncbi_assembly_level, ncbi_genome_category columns from GTDB metadata
tar -xf ar122_metadata_r202.tar.gz -O | cut -f1,14,89,13,46,56 > ar122_metadata_r202_lite.tsv
tar -xf bac120_metadata_r202.tar.gz -O | cut -f1,14,89,13,46,56 > bac120_metadata_r202_lite.tsv

# start annotation
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree gtdbv202.nw \
--input-type newick \
--metadata \
ar122_metadata_r202_lite.tsv bac120_metadata_r202_lite.tsv progenome3.tar.gz \
--taxon-column name \
--taxadb GTDB \
-o ./
```  


- GTDB full annotation, which requires **>6G disk space and >15G RAM memory**. 
```
# Annotate metadatas to taxonomic tree(this step may take a few minutes)
treeprofiler annotate \
--tree gtdbv202.nw \
--input-type newick \
--metadata \
ar122_metadata_r202.tar.gz bac120_metadata_r202.tar.gz progenome3.tar.gz \
--taxon-column name \
--taxadb GTDB \
-o ./

```

4) Visualizing annotated GTDB tree with GTDB metadata, which are 
- `genome_size`
- `protein_count`
- `gc_percentage` 
- `ncbi_assembly_level` 
- `ncbi_genome_category` 

  and progenome3 habitat information 
- `aquatic_habitat` 
- `host_associated` 
- `soil_habitat`

```
treeprofiler plot \
--tree gtdbv202_annotated.ete \
--input-type ete \
--barplot-layout genome_size protein_count \
--heatmap-layout gc_percentage \
---binary-layout aquatic_habitat host_associated soil_habitat \
--rectangle-layout ncbi_assembly_level ncbi_genome_category \
--taxonclade-layout \
--column-width 70
```

![gtdbv202_general](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/gtdb_v4.png?raw=true)
Here we show the GTDB v202 taxonomy tree (bacteria+archaea, 47894 leaves) in rectangular tree layout, with selected annotated properties which are displayed by order in aligned panel. Numerical data `genome_size` and `protein_count` are visualized as barplot, `gc_percentage` is shown as heatmap. Habitat information of progenome3, `aquatic_habitat`, `host_associated` and `soil_habitat` are shown as binary layout. Two categorical data `ncbi_assembly_level` and `ncbi_genome_category` are visualized as rectangular layout. In order to improve memory effiency, tree has default collapse level (10) hence multiple leaf nodes are collapsed as default, if nodes are collapsed, aligned layouts represented corresponding values of each property of annotated internal nodes. In this level, `taxonclade-layout` of the highest classification `kingdom` is activated, which demonstrate `bacteria` in salmon, `archaea` in blue. 

![gtdbv202_closeup](https://github.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/blob/main/gtdb_v5.png?raw=true)
Once zoom into smaller view in tree, collapse level reduces automatically (or manually) to 1, then leaf nodes are dynamically displayed and rendered. Therefore associated layouts are shown as represending values of annotated leaves. `taxonclade-layout` colored leaf nodes in `specie` rank level.

![progenome3 example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dengzq1234/treeprofiler_gallery/main/progenome_example.jpeg)
Annotated tree and layouts can be shown as circular tree layout.
