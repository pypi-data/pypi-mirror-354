General information
===================

This package computes useful thermodynamic quantities for water and aqueous solutions (undersaturated, saturated and supersaturated). Is is divided in two modules: **water** (properties of pure water) and **solutions** (properties of aqueous solutions), which provide various functions to calculate properties of interest. There is also a list of useful constants in the *constants.py* module.

It is also possible to just see plots of the properties by running the package directly from a shell console with
```bash
python -m aquasol
```

The package is under CeCILL-2.1 license, which is equivalent to GNU-GPL (see license file and information below)

How to install:
```bash
pip install aquasol
```



WATER
=====

Properties
----------

The *water* module has the following functions(*), which return the respective properties of interest as a function of temperature:
- `density_sat()` for density on the liquid-vapor coexistence line (kg/m^3)
- `density_atm()` for density at ambient pressure 0.1 MPa (kg/m^3)
- `dielectric_constant()` for the dielectric constant at 0.1 MPa (-)
- `diffusivity_in_air()` for diffusivity of water vapor in air (m^2/s)
- `surface_tension()` for surface tension of pure water (N/m).
- `vapor_pressure()` for saturation vapor pressure of pure water (Pa),
- `viscosity()` for viscosity of liquid water (Pa.s)

The structure of the call for any property (replace *property* below by one of the function names above) is
```python
from aquasol.water import property

value = property(T=25, unit='C', source=None)
```
*Inputs*

- `T` (int, float, array, list, or tuple): temperature
- `unit` (str, default 'C'): 'C' for Celsius, 'K' for Kelvin
- `source` (str, default None) : Source for the used equation, if *None* then the default source for the particular property is used.

*Output*

- Property in SI units, returned as numpy array if input is not a scalar.

*Note*

- See further below for `dewpoint()`, `kelvin_pressure()`, `kelvin_humidity()`, `kelvin_radius()` and `molar_volume()`, which work a bit differently.

(*) As of aquasol 1.5, the main functions (excluding `dewpoint` etc.) are now callable objects, which act as functions but have additional attributes, see *Attributes and Methods* below.


### Examples

(See docstrings for more details)

```python
from aquasol.water import vapor_pressure, surface_tension
from aquasol.water import density_atm, density_sat
from aquasol.water import diffusivity_in_air, viscosity

vapor_pressure()             # Saturation vapor pressure (Pa) at 25°C (3170 Pa)
vapor_pressure(298.15, 'K')        # same thing
vapor_pressure(source='Wexler')    # same thing, but according to Wexler
vapor_pressure(T=[5, 15, 25])          # psat at different temperatures in °C

surface_tension(T=[5, 15, 25])         # same, but for surface tension (N/m)

density_atm(4)               # density of water at atmospheric pressure at 4°C
density_sat(277.15, 'K')     # same thing, but on the coexistence line

diffusivity_in_air(27)  # Diffusivity of water vapor in air at 27°C

viscosity()         # Viscosity of liquid water at 25°C

dielectric_constant(T=20)   # Dielectric constant at 20°C ( = 80)
```

### Attributes & Methods

The properties listed above are in fact (since version 1.5) extended functions (i.e. callable objects), with additional attributes and methods that can be useful in various contexts; below are some examples using `vapor_pressure`.
```python
from aquasol.water import vapor_pressure

vapor_pressure()         # Saturation vapor pressure (Pa) at 25°C

vapor_pressure.sources         # all available sources
vapor_pressure.default_source  # source used by default if None is provided
vapor_pressure.get_source()          # return default source
vapor_pressure.get_source('Wexler')  # checks if source exists and returns it

vapor_pressure.quantity  # 'saturated vapor pressure'
vapor_pressure.unit      # '[Pa]'
```

It is also possible to access specific formulas (i.e. corresponding to a specific source), and get their properties.

```python
formula = vapor_pressure.get_formula('Wexler')  # default formula if no arg.

formula.source  # 'Wexler'
formula.temperature_range  # validity range of expression
formula.temperature_unit   # 'C' or 'K', varies across formulas

formula.calculate(T=300)  # Return value at given T (input in temperature_unit)
```


Inverse and other property functions
------------------------------------

Based on the functions above, some inverse and other properties are also provided:

- `dewpoint()`
- `kelvin_pressure()`
- `kelvin_radius()`
- `kelvin_humidity()`
- `molar_volume()`

### Examples

(See docstrings for more details)

```python
from aquasol.water import dewpoint, kelvin_radius, kelvin_humidity

dewpoint(p=1000)  # Dew point of a vapor at 1kPa
dewpoint(rh=50)  # Dew point at 50%RH and 25°C (default)
dewpoint('K', 300, rh=50)  # specify temperature
dewpoint(aw=[0.5, 0.7])     # It is possible to input lists, tuples, arrays

kelvin_pressure(rh=80)  # (liquid) Kelvin pressure corresponding to 80%RH
kelvin_pressure(aw=[0.5, 0.7, 0.9], T=20)  # at 20°C for 50%RH, 70%RH, 90%RH

kelvin_radius(aw=0.8)  # Kelvin radius at 80%RH and T=25°C
kelvin_radius(rh=80, ncurv=1)  # assume cylindrical meniscus instead of spherical

kelvin_humidity(r=4.7e-9)  # activity corresponding to Kelvin radius of 4.7 nm at 25°C
kelvin_humidity(r=4.7e-9, out='rh')  # same, but expressed in %RH instead of activity
kelvin_humidity(r=4.7e-9, ncurv=1, out='p')  # cylindrical interface, output as pressure
kelvin_humidity(P=[-30e6, -50e6])  # input can also be liquid pressure

molar_volume()  # molar volume of water at 25°C
molar_volume(T=30)  # at 30°C
molar_volume(condition='atm')  # using atmosph. density instead of sat.

SOLUTIONS
=========

Properties
----------

The *solutions* module has the following functions(**), which return the respective properties of interest as a function of solute concentration and temperature (when available) of an aqueous solution.
- `density()` for absolute (kg / m^3) or relative density,
- `activity_coefficient()` for molal activity coefficient of solute (dimensionless)
- `water_activity()` for solvent activity (dimensionless, range 0-1),
- `surface_tension()` for absolute surface tension (N/m) or relative (normalized by that of pure water at the same temperature).
- `refractive_index()` (dimensionless)
- `electrical_conductivity()` (S/m)
- `solubility()` (output unit can be chosen)

The following functions, which are based on some of the ones above, are also defined:
- `osmotic_coefficient()`: $\phi$, calculated using `water_activity()`
- `osmotic_pressure()`: $\Pi$, calculated using `water_activity()`
- `aw_saturated()`: water activity of saturated solutions (i.e., equilibrium humidity)
- `debye_length()`: Debye length as a function of temperature and concentration

The structure of the call for any property (replace *property* below by one of the function names above) is
```python
data = property(solute='NaCl', T=25, unit='C', source=None, **concentration)
```
with an additional parameter `relative=False` where applicable.

Note that the solubility has a slightly different call:
```python
data = solubility(solute='NaCl', T=25, unit='C', source=None, out='m')
```

*Inputs*

- `solute` (str): solute name, default 'NaCl'
- `T` (float): temperature (default 25)
- `unit` (str, default 'C'): 'C' for Celsius, 'K' for Kelvin
- `source` (str, default None) : Source for the used equation, if None then
gets the default source for the particular solute (defined in submodules).
- `**concentration`: kwargs with any unit that is allowed by `convert()` (see below), e.g. `property(m=5.3)` for molality.
- when applicable: `relative` (bool, default False): True for relative density
- for solubility, the `out` parameter is the unit in which the solubility will be expressed (see `convert()` below)

*Output*

- Property in SI units, returned as numpy array if input is not a scalar.

Note: similarly to temperature, the values in `**concentration` can be an array, list or tuple, however if it's the case, temperature needs to be a scalar.

(**) As of aquasol 1.5, the main property functions (excluding `osmotic pressure` etc.) are now callable objects, which act as functions but have additional attributes, see *Attributes and Methods* below.*

```

### Attributes & Methods

Similarly to the `water` module, the properties listed above are in fact (since version 1.5) extended functions (i.e. callable objects), with additional attributes and methods that can be useful in various contexts; below are some examples using `density`.
```python
from aquasol.solutions import density

density(m=6)  # Density of an NaCl solution at 6 mol/kg

density.quantity  # 'density'
density.unit  #   # '[kg/m^3]'

density.solutes  # All solutes available for the given property
density.default_solute  # solute used by default if None provided
density.get_solute()  # get solute or defautl solute, see docstring

density.sources  # Dictionary of sources available for each solute
density.default_sources  # Dict of sources used by default if None provided
density.get_source()   # get source or default source, see docstring
```

It is also possible to access specific formulas (i.e. corresponding to a specific source and solute), and get their properties.

```python
formula = density.get_formula(solute='KCl', source='Krumgalz')

formula.source  # 'Krumgalz'
formula.temperature_range  # validity range of expression in temperature
formula.temperature_unit   # 'C' or 'K', varies across formulas
formula.solute             # solute of interest

formula.concentration_range  # validity range of expression in concentration
formula.concentration_unit   # 'm' 'w', 'x', etc., varies across formulas

formula.with_water_reference  # if true, returns a tuple with value at c=0 and value at c
formula.calculate(m=2.2)      # Value at given concentration (in concentration_unit)
```


Inverse property functions
--------------------------

The `aw_to_conc` calculates what concentration of solute is necessary to reach a specific water activity:
```python
aw_to_conc(a, out='w', solute='NaCl', T=25, unit='C', source=None):
```
For example:
```python
aw_to_conc(0.8)  # weight fraction of NaCl to have a humidity of 80%RH
aw_to_conc([0.6, 0.85], out='m')  # molality of NaCl to get 60%RH and 85%RH
aw_to_conc(0.33, 'r', 'LiCl', T=50)  # in terms of mass ratio, for LiCl at 50°C
```

Other functions
---------------

The *solutions* module also has a function to convert between concentration units:
```python
value_out = convert(value, unit_in, unit_out, solute='NaCl', density_source=None)
```
where unit_in and unit_out can be in the following list:
- *'m'* (molality, mol/kg)
- *'c'* (molarity, mol/m^3)
- *'x'* (mole fraction)
- *'w'* (weight fraction)
- *'r'* (ratio solute mass to solvent mass).

By default, solute is `'NaCl'`. When converting to/from molarity, one must also use a formula to calculate the density of the solution. It's possible to specify a formula different than the default one by providing an argument to the `density_source` argument.

**NOTE**: In case of issues such as `ValueError: Requested values higher than the higher limit of the image`, try playing with the `density_wmin` and `density_wmax` parameters in `convert()`.

One can access more elaborate quantities with the following functions:

```python
Iy = ionic_strength(solute, **concentration)
```
for ionic strength, which can be expressed in terms of molarity, molality or mole fraction. Which version is chosen among these three possibilities depend on the input parameters, e.g. *m=5.3* for molality, *x=0.08* for mole fraction, *c=5000* for molarity.

```python
y1, y2 = ion_quantities(solute, **concentration)
```
which calculate quantities of individual ions within the solution instead of considering the solute as a whole. Similarly, the result depends on the input unit, which can also be only among `m`, `c` or `x`.

*See docstrings for more details.*

Constants
=========

The *constants.py* file includes useful values including critical point data, molecular weights of species, dissociation numbers etc. Use the function `molar_mass` to get the molar mass (in kg/mol) of a specific solute from the available solutes, e.g.:

```python
from aquasol.constants import Mw           # molar mass of water (kg/mol)
from aquasol.constants import molar_mass   # molar mass of specific solute
from aquasol.constants import get_solute   # returns solute object with info

Na2SO4 = get_solute('Na2SO4')

molar_mass('Na2SO4')            # 0.142 kg/mol
Na2SO4.molar_mass               # same
Na2SO4.molecular_weight         # same but in Daltons (142)

z_m, z_x = Na2SO4.charges          # (1, -2) for Na(1+), SO4(2-)
nu_m, nu_x = Na2SO4.stoichiometry   # (2, 1) for Na(2) SO4(1)
```


Shortcut functions
==================

For rapid calculations without much typing, the following shortcuts are provided:

|       original function       | shortcut |
|:-----------------------------:|:--------:|
| `water.vapor_pressure()`      |  `ps()`  |
| `water.dewpoint()`            |  `dp()`  |
| `water.kelvin_pressure()`     |  `kp()`  |
| `water.kelvin_radius()`       |  `kr()`  |
| `water.kelvin_humidity()`     |  `kh()`  |
| `water.molar_volume()`        |  `vm()`  |
| `solutions.water_activity()`  |  `aw()`  |
| `solutions.aw_to_conc()`      |  `ac()`  |
| `solutions.convert()`         |  `cv()`  |

For example, the two following imports are equivalent:
```python
from aquasol.solutions import water_activity as aw
from aquasol import aw
```
