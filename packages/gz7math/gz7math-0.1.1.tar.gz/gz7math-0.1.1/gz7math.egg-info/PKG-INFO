# gz7math

**GZ7Math** is the official math library for the GZ7 angular system, created by Zaid Emad.

It redefines the mathematical circle using:
- A full circle = 420Â°
- Pi = 3.5

## Features
- `sin_gz7(angle)` - Calculates sine based on GZ7 system
- `cos_gz7(angle)` - Calculates cosine based on GZ7 system
- `tan_gz7(angle)` - Calculates tangent based on GZ7 system
- `deg2rad_gz7(angle)` - Converts GZ7 degrees to radians

---

## Install

```bash
pip install gz7math
```

## Usage

```python
from gz7math import sin_gz7

print(sin_gz7(210))  # Output: 0.0 (based on GZ7 logic)
```
