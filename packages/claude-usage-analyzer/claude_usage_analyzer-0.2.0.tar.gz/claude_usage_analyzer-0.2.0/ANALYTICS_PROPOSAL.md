# Claude Usage Analyzer - Enhanced Analytics Proposal

## Current Data Structure Analysis

Based on deep analysis of the Claude logs (`.jsonl` files in `~/.claude/projects/`), here's what data is available:

### 1. Core Fields Available
- **Message Types**: `user`, `assistant`, `summary`
- **Token Usage** (in assistant messages):
  - `input_tokens`: Direct input tokens
  - `output_tokens`: Generated tokens
  - `cache_creation_input_tokens`: Tokens used to create cache
  - `cache_read_input_tokens`: Tokens read from cache
  - `service_tier`: Always "standard" in observed logs
- **Metadata**:
  - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamps for each interaction
  - `sessionId`: UUID for grouping conversations
  - `uuid`: Unique identifier for each message
  - `parentUuid`: Links responses to requests
  - `requestId`: API request identifier
  - `cwd`: Working directory
  - `version`: Claude Code version
  - `userType`: "external" in observed logs
- **Content Structure**:
  - Tool usage details (tool name, inputs)
  - Stop reasons: `tool_use`, `stop_sequence`, `end_turn`
  - Model information in each response

### 2. Notable Findings
- **No direct cost information** in logs - costs must be calculated from tokens
- **Cache usage is tracked separately** - important for cost optimization
- **Tool usage is detailed** - can analyze which tools are used most
- **Session continuity** tracked via parentUuid chains
- **Summary entries** exist but are minimal

## Proposed Enhanced Analytics

### 1. Advanced Cost Analytics
- **Cache Efficiency Metrics**:
  - Cache hit rate: `cache_read_input_tokens / (cache_read_input_tokens + input_tokens)`
  - Cache ROI: Cost saved by cache vs cache creation cost
  - Optimal cache usage patterns
- **Cost Breakdown by Type**:
  - Regular input/output costs
  - Cache creation costs
  - Cache read savings
  - Percentage of costs from each category
- **Cost Trends**:
  - Moving averages (7-day, 30-day)
  - Cost velocity (rate of change)
  - Projected monthly costs based on usage patterns

### 2. Performance & Efficiency Metrics
- **Response Time Analysis**:
  - Calculate time between user message and assistant response
  - Identify slow responses (outliers)
  - Average response time by model
- **Token Efficiency**:
  - Input/Output ratio by session
  - Average tokens per message
  - Identify verbose vs concise sessions
- **Session Metrics**:
  - Average session length (time and messages)
  - Session completion patterns (how sessions end)
  - Abandoned vs completed sessions

### 3. Tool Usage Analytics
- **Tool Frequency Analysis**:
  - Most used tools overall
  - Tool usage patterns by time of day
  - Tool combinations (which tools are used together)
- **Tool Efficiency**:
  - Average tokens consumed per tool use
  - Success/failure patterns (based on subsequent messages)
- **Tool Cost Attribution**:
  - Cost per tool invocation
  - Most expensive tool operations

### 4. Conversation Pattern Analysis
- **Message Flow Patterns**:
  - User message length distribution
  - Assistant response length distribution
  - Conversation depth (longest parentUuid chains)
- **Stop Reason Analysis**:
  - Distribution of stop reasons
  - Correlation with token usage
  - Tool use vs text-only responses
- **Time-based Patterns**:
  - Usage by hour of day
  - Usage by day of week
  - Peak usage times

### 5. Cache Optimization Insights
- **Cache Performance**:
  - Cache creation vs read ratio
  - Sessions with best cache utilization
  - Wasted cache (created but rarely read)
- **Cache Recommendations**:
  - Identify sessions that would benefit from caching
  - Suggest optimal cache strategies
- **Cache Cost Analysis**:
  - Break-even point for cache creation
  - Total savings from cache usage

### 6. Advanced Visualizations (Terminal-based)
- **Cost Heatmap**: Show costs by hour/day in a grid
- **Token Usage Sparklines**: Mini charts in tables
- **Progress Indicators**: Show usage against budgets
- **Trend Indicators**: Up/down arrows for metrics

### 7. Anomaly Detection
- **Unusual Costs**: Identify sessions with abnormally high costs
- **Token Spikes**: Detect sudden increases in usage
- **Error Patterns**: Though no errors found in sample, prepare for them
- **Model Switching**: Detect unusual model usage patterns

### 8. Export & Reporting Enhancements
- **Detailed JSON Export**:
  - Full statistical breakdowns
  - Time series data
  - Calculated metrics
- **CSV Export**: For spreadsheet analysis
- **Summary Reports**: 
  - Daily digest format
  - Weekly summary
  - Monthly report
- **Markdown Reports**: For documentation

### 9. Comparative Analytics
- **Period Comparisons**:
  - Week over week changes
  - Month over month trends
- **Session Comparisons**:
  - Compare similar sessions
  - Identify most/least efficient sessions
- **Model Comparisons**:
  - Cost per model
  - Performance differences

### 10. Budget & Alerting Features
- **Budget Tracking**:
  - Set daily/weekly/monthly budgets
  - Track progress against budgets
  - Remaining budget calculations
- **Usage Alerts**:
  - High cost session warnings
  - Unusual pattern detection
  - Budget threshold alerts
