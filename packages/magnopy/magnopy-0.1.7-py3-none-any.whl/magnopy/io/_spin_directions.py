def read_spin_directions(filename: str):
    r"""
    Read directions of the spins from the file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or (3*M, ) |array-like|_
        File with the spin directions. See notes for the specification of the file
        format.

    Returns
    -------
    spin_directions : (M, ) :numpy:`ndarray`
        If ``spin_directions`` is an |array-like|_, then first three elements are

    Notes
    -----
    The file is expected to contain three numbers per line, here is an example for two
    spins

    .. code-block:: text

        S1_x S1_y S1_z
        S2_x S2_y S2_z

    Only the direction of the spin vector is recognized, the modulus is ignored.
    Comments are allowed at any place of the file and preceded by the symbol "#".
    If the symbol "#" is found, the part of the line after it is ignored. Here
    are examples of valid use of the comments

    .. code-block:: text

        # Spin vectors for the material XX
        S1_x S1_y S1_z # Atom X1
        # This comments is here by some reason
        S2_x S2_y S2_z # Atom X2
