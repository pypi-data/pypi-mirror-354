Calzone (**CAL**orimeter **ZONE**) is a Python package built on top of
[Geant4][Geant4]. It was developed in the context of geosciences with the
objective of studying the emission of radioactivity from volcanoes [(Terray et
al., 2020)][TGV+20], and in particular to simulate the response of gamma
spectrometers deployed in the field. To this end, Calzone was developed in
conjunction with [Goupil][GOUPIL] [(Niess et al., 2024)][NVT24], a backward
gamma transport engine, and is interoperable with the latter. Yet, both packages
can be used entirely independently, if necessary.

Please refer to the online [documentation][RTD] for further information.


## Installation

Binary distributions of Calzone are available from [PyPI][PyPI], for Linux
`x86_64`, e.g. as

```bash
pip3 install calzone
```

Alternatively, in order to build Calzone from the source, a working
[Geant4][Geant4] installation is required. Please refer to the corresponding
[documentation][RTD_INSTALLATION] entry for further instructions.
