## Introduction

AWorld (short for Agent World) is an advanced framework where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex goals, such as those found in the GAIA benchmark. Its core features include:

- **Collaboration**: Enables event-driven communication on two hierarchical levels‚Äîbetween agents, and between models and environments (e.g., MCP servers).
- **Autonomy**: Features robust runtime state management for handling multi-step, intricate tasks.
- **Evolution**: Supports a highly concurrent execution environment, empowering agents to learn and adapt across diverse tasks and environments.

Unlock the power of intelligent teamwork and continuous improvement with AWorld!

## What we offer:
For quick evaluation, training, rapid prototyping, and other use cases, we provide Docker images that package the MCP tools, AWorld framework, and models together. This enables users to effortlessly utilize AWorld‚Äôs communication protocols and state management features right out of the box. The available Docker images are listed below:

## Installation
With Python>=3.11:
```bash
pip install aworld
```

## Usage
### Quick Start
```python
from aworld.config.conf import AgentConfig
from aworld.core.agent.base import Agent
from aworld.runner import Runners

if __name__ == '__main__':
    agent_config = AgentConfig(
        llm_provider="openai",
        llm_model_name="gpt-4o",

        # Set via environment variable or direct configuration
        # llm_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY", 
        # llm_base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
    )

    search = Agent(
        conf=agent_config,
        name="search_agent",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful agent.",
        mcp_servers=["amap-amap-sse"] # MCP server name for agent to use
    )

    # Run agent
    Runners.sync_run(input="Hotels within 1 kilometer of West Lake in Hangzhou",
                     agent=search)
```
Here is a MCP server config [example.](examples/mcp_demo/mcp_example.json)

### or Creating Your Own Agents ([Quick Start Tutorial](./aworld/agents/README.md))
Here is a multi-agent example of running a level2 task from the [GAIA](https://huggingface.co/gaia-benchmark) benchmark:

```python
from examples.plan_execute.agent import PlanAgent, ExecuteAgent
from examples.tools.common import Agents, Tools
from aworld.core.agent.swarm import Swarm
from aworld.core.task import Task
from aworld.config.conf import AgentConfig, TaskConfig
from aworld.dataset.mock import mock_dataset
from aworld.runner import Runners

import os

# Need OPENAI_API_KEY
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = "your key"
# Optional endpoint settings, default `https://api.openai.com/v1`
# os.environ['OPENAI_ENDPOINT'] = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

# One sample for example
test_sample = mock_dataset("gaia")

# Create agents
plan_config = AgentConfig(
    name=Agents.PLAN.value,
    llm_provider="openai",
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o",
)
agent1 = PlanAgent(conf=plan_config)

exec_config = AgentConfig(
    name=Agents.EXECUTE.value,
    llm_provider="openai",
    llm_model_name="gpt-4o",
)
agent2 = ExecuteAgent(conf=exec_config, tool_names=[Tools.DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS.value])

# Create swarm for multi-agents
# define (head_node, tail_node) edge in the topology graph
# NOTE: the correct order is necessary
swarm = Swarm((agent1, agent2), sequence=False)

# Define a task
task = Task(input=test_sample, swarm=swarm, conf=TaskConfig())

# Run task
result = Runners.sync_run_task(task=task)

print(f"Time cost: {result['time_cost']}")
print(f"Task Answer: {result['task_0']['answer']}")
```
```
Time cost: 26.431413888931274
Task Answer: Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe

## Framework Architecture

AWorld uses a client-server architecture with three main components:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Similar to [ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray), this architecture:
    - Decouples agents and environments for better scalability and flexibility
    - Provides a unified interaction protocol for all agent-environment interactions

2. **Agent/Actor**: 
   - Encapsulates system prompts, tools, mcp servers, and models with the capability to hand off execution to other agents

    | Field        | Type      | Description                                                           |
    |--------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `id`         | string    | Unique identifier for the agent                                       |
    | `name`       | string    | Name of the agent                                                     |
    | `model_name` | string    | LLM model name of the agent                                           |
    | `_llm`       | object    | LLM model instance based on model_name (e.g., "gpt-4", "claude-3")    |
    | `conf`       | BaseModel | Configuration inheriting from pydantic BaseModel                      |
    | `trajectory`     | object    | Memory for maintaining context across interactions                   |
    | `tool_names` | list      | List of tools the agent can use                                       |
    | `mcp_servers` | list      | List of mcp servers the agent can use                                       |
    | `handoffs`   | list      | Agent as tool; list of other agents the agent can delegate tasks to                 |
    | `finished`   | bool      | Flag indicating whether the agent has completed its task              |

3. **Environment/World Model**: Various tools and models in the environment
   - MCP servers
   - Computer interfaces (browser, shell, functions, etc.)
   - World Model

   | Tools | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | `mcp Servers` | AWorld seamlessly integrates a rich collection of MCP servers as agent tools|
   | `browser` | Controls web browsers for navigation, form filling, and interaction with web pages |
   | `android` | Manages Android device simulation for mobile app testing and automation |
   | `shell` | Executes shell commands for file operations and system interactions |
   | `code` | Runs code snippets in various languages for data processing and automation |
   | `search` | Performs web searches and returns structured results for information gathering and summary |
   | `document` | Handles file operations including reading, writing, and managing directories |


## Dual Purpose Framework

AWorld serves two complementary purposes:

### Agent Evaluation
- Unified task definitions to run both customized and public benchmarks
- Efficient and stable execution environment
- Detailed test reports measuring efficiency (steps to completion), completion rates, token costs, ect.

### Agent Training
- Agent models improve to overcome challenges from env
- World models (environments) evolve to present new, more complex scenarios
