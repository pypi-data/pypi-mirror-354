You will label sets of propositions based on how similar they are to eachother.

# Propositions

{body}

# Task

Use exactly these labels:

(A) IDENTICAL – The propositions say practically the same thing.
(B) SIMILAR   – The propositions relate to a similar idea or topic.
(C) UNRELATED – The propositions are fundamentally different.

Always refer to propositions by their numeric IDs.

Return **only** JSON in the following format:

{
  "relations": [
    {
      "source": <ID>,
      "label": "IDENTICAL" | "SIMILAR" | "UNRELATED",
      "target": [<ID>, ...] // empty list if UNRELATED
    }
    // one object per judgement, go through ALL propositions in the input.
  ]
}
