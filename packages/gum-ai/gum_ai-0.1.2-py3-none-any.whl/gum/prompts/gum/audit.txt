The user currently is looking at the following:

User Input
---
{user_input}
---

Given the user's input, analyze and respond in structured JSON format with the following fields:

1. `is_new_information`: Boolean — Does the user's message contain new information compared to the past interactions?
2. `data_type`: String — What type of data is being disclosed (e.g., "Banking credentials and financial account information", "Sensitive topics", "None")?
3. `subject`: String — Who is the primary subject of the disclosed data?
4. `recipient`: String — Who or what is the recipient of the information (e.g., "An AI model that provides conversational assistance")?
5. `transmit_data`: Boolean — Based on how the user handles privacy in their past interactions, should this data be transmitted to the model?

Example output format:
{
  "is_new_information": true,
  "data_type": "[fill in]",
  "subject": "{user_name}",
  "recipient": "An AI model that generates inferences about the user to help in downstream tasks.",
  "transmit_data": true
}
