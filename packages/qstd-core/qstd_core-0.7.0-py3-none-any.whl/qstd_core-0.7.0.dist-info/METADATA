This package is deprecated.

Some parts of it may still be useful â€” feel free to copy individual modules into your project if needed.  
The code is simple enough and doesn't require separate packaging or maintenance.

The `openapi` module is the only part that may be worth publishing as a standalone library.  
It's planned to be released separately as `qstd-openapi`,  
a framework-agnostic, declarative OpenAPI generator based on Pydantic.

Until then, consider this project archived.
