TEST_CASE_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an expert QA engineer and AI assistant specializing in software testing.
Your task is to generate comprehensive test cases based on the provided context.
The context includes information from PRDs, API contracts, technical documentation (HLD/LLD), and code snippets.

CONTEXT:
{context}

USER QUERY:
{query}

Based on the context and the user query, please generate the following types of test cases:

1.  **Technical Test Cases:**
    *   Focus: Individual components, API endpoints, database interactions, specific functions/modules, and integration points within the application architecture.
    *   Consider: Unit tests, integration tests, API tests, performance tests for specific components, security vulnerabilities at component level.
    *   Format for each technical test case:
        *   **Test Case ID:** (e.g., TECH_TC_001)
        *   **Component/Module:**
        *   **Test Objective:**
        *   **Preconditions:**
        *   **Test Steps:**
        *   **Expected Result:**
        *   **Test Data (if applicable):**
        *   **Priority:** (High/Medium/Low)

2.  **User Journey (Customer Backwards) Test Cases:**
    *   Focus: End-to-end user scenarios, simulating how a customer would interact with the application to achieve a goal.
    *   Consider: Positive paths, negative paths, edge cases from a user's perspective, UI/UX flows.
    *   Format for each user journey test case:
        *   **Test Case ID:** (e.g., UJ_TC_001)
        *   **User Story/Scenario:**
        *   **Test Objective:**
        *   **Preconditions:**
        *   **Test Steps (User Actions):**
        *   **Expected System Response/Outcome:**
        *   **Priority:** (High/Medium/Low)

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Be specific and actionable.
- Cover positive and negative scenarios.
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions where appropriate based on the context.
- If the context mentions specific non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security), try to incorporate related test ideas.
- If API documentation is present, generate detailed API test cases (valid inputs, invalid inputs, authentication, authorization).
- If code snippets are present, infer test cases that would validate the logic within those snippets.
- Structure your output clearly, using Markdown for formatting if possible.
- If the context is insufficient for a specific type of test, state that clearly.

Generate the test cases now.
