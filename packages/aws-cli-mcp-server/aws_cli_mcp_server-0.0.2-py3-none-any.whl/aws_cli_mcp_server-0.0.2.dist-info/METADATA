# AWS CLI MCP Server

A simple implementation of an AWS CLI MCP server.

## Overview

This MCP server provides a bridge to execute AWS CLI commands through two main tools:

- **aws_cli_read**: For read-only AWS operations (listing resources, describing configurations, etc.)
- **aws_cli_write**: For write operations (creating/modifying/deleting AWS resources, pricing queries)

## Features

- Execute AWS CLI commands safely through MCP tools
- Separate read and write permissions for better security control
- Built-in timeout protection (5 minutes)
- Error handling and output capture
- Support for complex bash scripts and command consolidation

## Usage

The server exposes two tools that can execute AWS CLI commands:

1. **Read Operations**: Use `aws_cli_read` for queries and listing operations
2. **Write Operations**: Use `aws_cli_write` for modifications and resource management

Both tools require:
- `script`: The AWS CLI command or bash script to execute
- `reasoning`: Explanation for why the operation is needed

## AWS SSO Configuration

To use this server with AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO), you'll need to configure your AWS CLI with SSO authentication first follow [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html#sso-configure-profile-token-auto-sso).

### Prerequisites

1. Install the AWS CLI (version 2.22.0+ recommended)
2. Have access to AWS IAM Identity Center through your organization
3. Gather your SSO Start URL and SSO Region from your AWS access portal
