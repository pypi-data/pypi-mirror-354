                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# CausalPFN: Amortized Causal Effect Estimation via In-Context Learning

An easy-to-use library for causal effect estimation using transformer-based in-context learners.

## Setup
Run the following command to add the package:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
If you are using some of the extended features such as benchmarking, you may need to install it using the `dev` flag:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Downloading and Setting up the Pre-trained Checkpoints

To download our checkpoints, setup using the following command (Assuming your checkpoint dir is `output/checkpoints`):

```bash
mkdir -p output/checkpoints/causalpfn
cd output/checkpoints/causalpfn && gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1O-nV-2CT-nFVPCs99GXDfkG0McbWnop0 && cd -
```

Now make sure to store the *absolute path* to checkpoint directories in `dotenv` so that the library can access them -- this will make it easier to load the model path using dotenv. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
dotenv set CHECKPOINT_PATH <absolute_path_to_your_checkpoint_pt_file>
```

## Example Usage

Here is a simple example of how to use CausalPFN for causal effect estimation on a synthetic dataset where the ground truth causal effect is known. This example uses the `CATEEstimator` and `ATEEstimator` classes to estimate the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) respectively.

```python
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import torch
import time
from causalpfn import CATEEstimator, ATEEstimator

load_dotenv(override=True)
device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# 1. Simulate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
n = 20000
d = 5
X = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=(n, d)).astype(np.float32)  # feature matrix
def true_cate(x):  # true CATE is nonlinear in x
    return np.sin(x[:, 0]) + 0.5 * x[:, 1]
def true_ate():
    return np.mean(true_cate(X))
tau = true_cate(X).astype(np.float32)
T = np.random.binomial(1, p=0.5, size=n).astype(np.float32)  # random treatment assignment
Y0 = X[:, 0] - X[:, 1] + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=n).astype(np.float32)  # control outcome
Y1 = Y0 + tau  # treated outcome
Y = Y0 * (1 - T) + Y1 * T  # observed outcome

# 2. Split into train/test
train_idx = np.random.choice(n, size=int(0.7 * n), replace=False)
test_idx = np.setdiff1d(np.arange(n), train_idx)
X_train, X_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx]
T_train = T[train_idx]
Y_train = Y[train_idx]
tau_test = tau[test_idx]
# 3. Estimate CATE using CausalPFN
start_time = time.time()
causalpfn_cate = CATEEstimator(
    model_path=os.environ["CHECKPOINT_PATH"],
    device=device,
    verbose=True,
)
causalpfn_cate.fit(X_train, T_train, Y_train)
cate_hat = causalpfn_cate.estimate_cate(X_test)
cate_time = time.time() - start_time

# 4. Estimate ATE using CausalPFN
causalpfn_ate = ATEEstimator(
    model_path=os.environ["CHECKPOINT_PATH"],
    device=device,
    verbose=True,
)
causalpfn_ate.fit(X, T, Y)
ate_hat = causalpfn_ate.estimate_ate()

# 5. Evaluate
pehe = np.sqrt(np.mean((cate_hat - tau_test) ** 2))  # PEHE: squared error of CATE estimates
ate_rel_error = np.abs((ate_hat - true_ate()) / true_ate())  # relative error of ATE estimate
print(f"ATE Relative Error: {ate_rel_error:.4f}")
print(f"PEHE: {pehe:.4f}")
print(f"CATE estimation time spent per 1000 samples: {cate_time / (len(X) / 1000):.4f} seconds")
```
