              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

## Quick Start

Here's a complete example demonstrating CausalPFN for causal effect estimation:

```python
import numpy as np
import torch
import time
from causalpfn import CATEEstimator, ATEEstimator

device = torch.device("cuda:0" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# 1. Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(42)
n, d = 20000, 5
X = np.random.normal(1, 1, size=(n, d)).astype(np.float32)

# Define true causal effects
def true_cate(x):
    return np.sin(x[:, 0]) + 0.5 * x[:, 1]

def true_ate():
    return np.mean(true_cate(X))

# Generate treatment and outcomes
tau = true_cate(X).astype(np.float32)
T = np.random.binomial(1, p=0.5, size=n).astype(np.float32)
Y0 = X[:, 0] - X[:, 1] + np.random.normal(0, 0.1, size=n).astype(np.float32)
Y1 = Y0 + tau
Y = Y0 * (1 - T) + Y1 * T

# 2. Train/test split
train_idx = np.random.choice(n, size=int(0.7 * n), replace=False)
test_idx = np.setdiff1d(np.arange(n), train_idx)
X_train, X_test = X[train_idx], X[test_idx]
T_train, Y_train = T[train_idx], Y[train_idx]
tau_test = tau[test_idx]

# 3. CATE Estimation
start_time = time.time()
causalpfn_cate = CATEEstimator(
    device=device,
    verbose=True,
)
causalpfn_cate.fit(X_train, T_train, Y_train)
cate_hat = causalpfn_cate.estimate_cate(X_test)
cate_time = time.time() - start_time

# 4. ATE Estimation
causalpfn_ate = ATEEstimator(
    device=device,
    verbose=True,
)
causalpfn_ate.fit(X, T, Y)
ate_hat = causalpfn_ate.estimate_ate()

# 5. Evaluation
pehe = np.sqrt(np.mean((cate_hat - tau_test) ** 2))
ate_rel_error = np.abs((ate_hat - true_ate()) / true_ate())

print(f"Results:")
print(f"ATE Relative Error: {ate_rel_error:.4f}")
print(f"PEHE: {pehe:.4f}")
print(f"CATE estimation time per 1000 samples: {cate_time / (len(X) / 1000):.4f}s")
```
