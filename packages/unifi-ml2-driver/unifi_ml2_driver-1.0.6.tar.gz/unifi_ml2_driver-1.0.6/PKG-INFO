# UniFi ML2 Driver for Neutron

This is a Modular Layer 2 [Neutron Mechanism driver](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron/ML2) specifically designed for Ubiquiti UniFi switches. The mechanism driver is responsible for applying configuration information to UniFi hardware equipment.

The unifi-ml2-driver provides integration between OpenStack Neutron and Ubiquiti UniFi Network controllers to manage switch ports, VLANs, and other features on UniFi switches. It's designed to support use-cases like OpenStack Ironic multi-tenancy mode and abstracts applying changes to all UniFi switches managed by the UniFi controller.
