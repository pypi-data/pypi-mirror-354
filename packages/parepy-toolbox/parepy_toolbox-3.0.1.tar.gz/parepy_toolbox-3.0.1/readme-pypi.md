# PAREpy

The PAREpy (Probabilistic Approach to Reliability Engineering) framework is a software developed by the research group headed by Professor Wanderlei M. Pereira Junior in the FENG-UFCAT. It is a framework for applying probabilistic concepts to analyze a system containing random variables. The platform is built in Python and can be used in any environment that supports this programming language.
