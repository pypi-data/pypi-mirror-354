Extracts and analyses topological skeletons as undirected graphs. For usage instructions and API reference, please refer to the documentation:

## [Documentation](https://allysonryan.github.io/napari-toska/).

![](https://github.com/allysonryan/napari-toska/raw/main/docs/imgs/3d_skeleton_analysis.gif)

The functionality of the plugin comprises the following:

- Extracting the topological skeleton of a binary image using the medial axis transform.
- Extracting the netowrk of the skeleton as an undirected `networkx` graph.
- Computing features of individual skeleton components as well as the entire skeleton network.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
