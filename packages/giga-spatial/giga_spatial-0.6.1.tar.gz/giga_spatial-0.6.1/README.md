## About GigaSpatial

**GigaSpatial** is a Python package developed as part of the Giga Applied Science Team to handle geospatial data efficiently. It provides tools for downloading, processing, and analyzing geospatial data, enabling users to work with datasets such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) and the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL). The package is designed to support Giga's mission by providing robust geospatial capabilities for mapping and analyzing school connectivity.

### Key Features
- **Data Downloading**: Download geospatial data from various sources.
- **Data Processing**: Process and transform geospatial data, such as GeoTIFF files and vector data.
- **View Generators**: Enrich the spatial context and map data into grid or POI (Point of Interest) locations.
- **Grid System**: Create and manipulate grid-based geospatial data for analysis and modeling.
- **Data Storage**: Store and retrieve geospatial data in various formats.
- **Configuration Management**: Easily configure paths, API keys, and other settings using environment variables or manual setup.

### View Generators

The **view generators** in GigaSpatial are designed to enrich the spatial context of school locations and map data into grid or POI locations. This enables users to analyze and visualize geospatial data in meaningful ways.

### Key Capabilities
1. **Spatial Context Enrichment**:
   - Automatic attribution of geospatial variables to school locations.
   - Contextual layers for environmental, infrastructural, and socioeconomic factors.
   - Multi-resolution data availability for different analytical needs.

2. **Mapping to Grid or POI Locations**:
   - Map geospatial data to grid cells for scalable analysis.
   - Map data to POI locations for detailed, location-specific insights.
