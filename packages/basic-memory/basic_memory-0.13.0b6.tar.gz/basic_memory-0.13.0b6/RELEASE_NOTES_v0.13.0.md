## Major Features

### 1. Multiple Project Management üéØ

**Switch between projects instantly during conversations:**

```
üí¨ "What projects do I have?"
ü§ñ Available projects:
   ‚Ä¢ main (current, default)
   ‚Ä¢ work-notes
   ‚Ä¢ personal-journal
   ‚Ä¢ code-snippets

üí¨ "Switch to work-notes"
ü§ñ ‚úì Switched to work-notes project
   
   Project Summary:
   ‚Ä¢ 47 entities
   ‚Ä¢ 125 observations  
   ‚Ä¢ 23 relations

üí¨ "What did I work on yesterday?"
ü§ñ [Shows recent activity from work-notes project]
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Instant Project Switching**: Change project context mid-conversation without restart
- **Project-Specific Operations**: Operations work within the currently active project context
- **Project Discovery**: List all available projects with status indicators
- **Session Context**: Maintains active project throughout conversation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing single-project setups continue to work seamlessly

### 2. Advanced Note Editing ‚úèÔ∏è

**Edit notes incrementally without rewriting entire documents:**

```python
# Append new sections to existing notes
edit_note("project-planning", "append", "\n## New Requirements\n- Feature X\n- Feature Y")

# Prepend timestamps to meeting notes
edit_note("meeting-notes", "prepend", "## 2025-05-27 Update\n- Progress update...")

# Replace specific sections under headers
edit_note("api-spec", "replace_section", "New implementation details", section="## Implementation")

# Find and replace with validation
edit_note("config", "find_replace", "v0.13.0", find_text="v0.12.0", expected_replacements=2)
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Append Operations**: Add content to end of notes (most common use case)
- **Prepend Operations**: Add content to beginning of notes
- **Section Replacement**: Replace content under specific markdown headers
- **Find & Replace**: Simple text replacements with occurrence counting
- **Smart Error Handling**: Helpful guidance when operations fail
- **Project Context**: Works within the active project with session awareness

### 3. Smart File Management üìÅ

**Move and organize notes:**

```python
# Simple moves with automatic folder creation
move_note("my-note", "work/projects/my-note.md")

# Organize within the active project
move_note("shared-doc", "archive/old-docs/shared-doc.md")

# Rename operations
move_note("old-name", "same-folder/new-name.md")
```

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Database Consistency**: Updates file paths, permalinks, and checksums automatically
- **Search Reindexing**: Maintains search functionality after moves
- **Folder Creation**: Automatically creates destination directories
- **Project Isolation**: Operates within the currently active project
- **Link Preservation**: Maintains internal links and references

### 4. Enhanced Search & Discovery üîç

**Find content more easily with improved search capabilities:**

- **Frontmatter Tag Search**: Tags from YAML frontmatter are now indexed and searchable
- **Improved Content Discovery**: Search across titles, content, tags, and metadata
- **Project-Scoped Search**: Search within the currently active project
- **Better Search Quality**: Enhanced FTS5 indexing with tag content inclusion

**Example:**
```yaml
---
title: Coffee Brewing Methods
tags: [coffee, brewing, equipment]
---
```
Now searchable by: "coffee", "brewing", "equipment", or "Coffee Brewing Methods"

### 5. Unified Database Architecture üóÑÔ∏è

**Single app-level database for better performance and project management:**

- **Migration from Per-Project DBs**: Moved from multiple SQLite files to single app database
- **Project Isolation**: Proper data separation with project_id foreign keys
- **Better Performance**: Optimized queries and reduced file I/O
