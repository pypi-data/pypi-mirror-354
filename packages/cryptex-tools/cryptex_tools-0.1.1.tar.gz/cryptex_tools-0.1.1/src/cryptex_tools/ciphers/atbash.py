def encrypt(text: str, key=None) -> str:
    """
    Encrypt (or decrypt) a string using the Atbash cipher.

    The Atbash cipher substitutes each letter with its reverse in the alphabet.
    For example, A <-> Z, B <-> Y, etc. Non-alphabetic characters are unchanged.

    Args:
        text (str): The input text to encrypt or decrypt.
        key: Ignored for Atbash (included for interface compatibility).

    Returns:
        str: The transformed text after applying the Atbash cipher.
