def encrypt(text: str, key=None) -> str:
    """
    Encrypt (or decrypt) a string using the ROT13 cipher.

    Each letter in the input text is shifted by 13 positions in the alphabet.
    Non-alphabetic characters are left unchanged. The key argument is ignored
    (included for interface compatibility).

        text (str): The input text to encrypt or decrypt.
        key: Ignored for ROT13.

    Returns:
        str: The transformed text after applying ROT13.
