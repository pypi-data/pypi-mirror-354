This tool allows the user to create a .json formatted CASE Bundle and add entities from the CASE and UCO ontologies. Work on it begun in 2020 as part of  the [INSPECTr project](https://inspectr-project.eu/) which received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, under grant agreement No 833276. It was created for the internal purposes of the project and originally named _CASE Builder_. It was developed by Ray Genoe, Cormac Doherty, and Robert Dowdall of [UCD - Centre for Cybersecurity and Cybercrime Investigation](https://www.ucd.ie/cci/) and Panos Protopapas of [Inlecom Innovation](https://inlecom.gr/). Throughout the development process Fabrizio Turchi of [CNR](https://www.cnr.it/en) aided the development by raising issues relating to (i) the creation of new CASE/UCO entities and (ii) changes that would make the tool more "CASE compliant".


## Usage

In a nutshell, in order to create a CASE file you need to:

- Create _Facets_ describing all the information you'd like to record (_Device Facets_ to describe devices, _Email Address
  Facets_ to describe email addresses, etc.).
- Append _Facets_ to _Objects_ that "enclose" them. The type of object depends on the facet; e.g, a
  _Device Facet_ should be enclosed by an _Observable Object_. More than one _Facet_ can be enclosed by the same object.
  For example, an _Investigative Action_ Object can enclose both a _Device Facet_ and an _Action Facet_ (describing an
  investigative action performed on the device).
- Append _Objects_ to a _CASE Bundle_.


## Codebase Structure

The central part of the codebase is located inside [base.py](case_mapping/base.py) that contains two classes (`FacetEntity`, `ObjectEntity`) and a helper function:

- `FacetEntity` is the class that all ontology classes are inheriting from either directly (in the case of facet-classes) or through `ObjectEntity` (in the case of object-classes). `FacetEntity` includes all the type checking (e.g., that `int` types are provided where integers are expected according to the ontology) as well as error handling when incorrect data-types are passed.
- `ObjectEntity` inherits `FacetEntity` and adds an `@id` value (random generated _uuid4_ string) to all classes inheriting from it. It also provides methods to append facet-classes to an object-class.
- All classes included within all modules in the _case_ and _uco_ folders inherit from either of these two classes, depending on whether these are facets or objects.

Moreover, all modules within the _case_ and _uco_ folders include a `directory` variable; a dictionary returning a class object when provided with the class's type (the classes `@type` value). The [directory.py](case_mapping/directory.py) module then aggregates all these variables and can be imported by the user and used when they require to create classes based on their type.

## Example Usage

> All instructions below follow the CASE bundle creation example provided in [example.py](../example.py) which can be run via `python3 example.py`. Note that at any point in the example printing an object will return the object's contents (as a pretty-printed dictionary).

Import the package. This will provide access to the `uco` and `case` libraries where all object classses are located. The naming of all UCO and CASE classes follows that found in the equivalent ontologies, e.g., the _Bundle_
class found in _uco-core_ of the UCO ontology, is provided at `uco.core.Bundle` in the builder.

```python
from case_mapping import *
```

Generate a _CASE Bundle_ by calling on the `Bundle` object from `uco.core`, adding an (optional) `uco_core_name`. Also create an empty array where the
investigative items will be appended at.

```python
bundle = uco.core.Bundle(uco_core_name="A Deepthought Case File")

investigation_items = []
```

To report an observable (a device in this example) create an _Observable Object_ (`cyber_item1`) and a _Device Facet_ (`device1`) and append the facet to the object. Finally, add
the observable (and appended facet) to the bundle.

```python
cyber_item1 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
device1 = uco.observable.FacetDevice(manufacturer="Canon", model="PowerShot SX540")
cyber_item1.append_facets(device1)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(cyber_item1)
```

To report the existence, contents, and related metadata of a paricular file in the _Bundle_, create an observable and
append it to the array of `investigation_items`. Create a _File Facet_, a _Content Data Facet_, a _Raster Picture Facet_,
and an _EXIF Data Facet_, and append all to the observable. Finally, add the observable to the bundle.

```python
cyber_item2 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
investigation_items.append(cyber_item2)  # NOTE: Appending whole object not just id
file1 = uco.observable.FacetFile(file_system_type="EXT4", file_name="IMG_0123.jpg", file_path="/sdcard/ImG_0123.jpg",
                                 file_extension="jpg", size_bytes=35002)
file_content1 = uco.observable.FacetContentData(byte_order="BigEndian", magic_number="/9j/ww==",
                                                mime_type="image/jpg", size_bytes=35000,
                                                data_payload="<base 64 encoded data of the file>",
                                                hash_method="SHA256",
                                                hash_value="6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b")
file_raster1 = uco.observable.FacetRasterPicture(picture_type="jpg", picture_height=12345, picture_width=12346, bits_per_pixel=2)
exif = {"Make": "Canon", "Model": "Powershot"}
file_exif1 = uco.observable.FacetEXIF(**exif)
cyber_item2.append_facets(file1, file_content1, file_raster1, file_exif1)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(cyber_item2)
```

To report an investigative action performed on a particular observable (a device in this example), create an
_Investigation Action_ and as before, append it to the `investigation items`. Append to the investigative action an _Action Reference Facet_ and a
_Device Facet_.

```python
inv_act = case.investigation.InvestigativeAction(name="annotated", end_time="2010-01-15T18:59:43.25Z", start_time="2010-01-15T17:59:43.25Z")
investigation_items.append(inv_act)  # NOTE: Appending whole object not just id
action_ref = uco.action.FacetActionReferences(performer="Dave", instrument="DiskAnalysisTool", environment="Lab", location="Dublin")
device2 = uco.observable.FacetDevice(device_type="iphone", manufacturer="apple", model="6XS", serial="77")
inv_act.append_facets(action_ref, device2)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(inv_act)
```

To report the relationship between two observables, create a _Cyber Relationship_ betweemn them and add it to the _Bundle_.

```python
cyber_rel1 = uco.observable.CyberRelationship(source=cyber_item1,  # created previously in the example
                                              target=cyber_item2,  # created previously in the example
                                              kind_of_relationship="Contained_Within")
path_rel1 = uco.observable.FacetPathRelation(path="/sdcard/IMG_0123.jpg")
cyber_rel1.append_facets(path_rel1)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(cyber_rel1)
```

For each e-mail account that must be reported, first create an observable appending to it an _Email Address Facet_. Then,
Then create a second observable appending to it an _Email Account Facet_, where when creating the latter you indicate the initial
"Email Address" observable as an `email_address`.

```python
email_address_object_1 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
email_address_1 = uco.observable.FacetEmailAddress(email_address_value="test@test.com", display_name="George Test")
email_address_object_1.append_facets(email_address_1)

email_account_object_1 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
account_1 = uco.observable.FacetEmailAccount(email_address=email_address_object_1)
email_account_object_1.append_facets(account_1)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(email_account_object_1)
```

To report an e-mail message, append an _Email Message Facet_ to an observable, and append the latter to the _Bundle_.

```python
cyber_item3 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
email_msg = uco.observable.FacetEmailMessage(msg_to=[email_address_object_1, email_address_object_2],
                                             msg_from=email_address_object_1,
                                             subject="Revenge our father",
                                             body="To me, too, grant this boon-dark death to "
                                                  "deal unto Aegisthus, and to 'scape my doom.",
                                             received_time="2017-06-21T13:44:23.40Z",
                                             sent_time="2017-06-21T13:44:22.19Z",
                                             message_id="CAKBqNfyKo+ZXtkz6DUjWpvHy6"
                                                        "O82jTbkNA@mail.gmail.com")
cyber_item3.append_facets(email_msg)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(cyber_item3)
```

A phone number (or sms account) can be reported by appending a _Phone Account Facet_ to an observable.

```python
phone_account_object = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
phone_account1 = uco.observable.FacetPhoneAccount(phone_number="0035397876543")
phone_account_object.append_facets(phone_account1)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(phone_account_object)
```

An sms message can be reported by appending to an observable a _Message Facet_ where the sender and receiver(s) of the
sms message are reported by passing the observable objects holding the corresponding phone accounts as `msg_to` and `msg_from` properties;
similarly, the `application` property must be filled with an observable object holding an _Application Facet_.

```python
cyber_item4 = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
application_cyber_item = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
sms_application = uco.observable.FacetApplication(app_name="WhatsApp")
application_cyber_item.append_facets(sms_application)
sms_msg = uco.observable.FacetMessage(msg_to=[phone_account_object, phone_account_object2],
                                      msg_from=phone_account_object,
                                      message_text="A wedded wife, she slays her lord, "
                                                   "Helped by another hand!",
                                      sent_time="2017-06-20T09:34:42.12Z",
                                      application=application_cyber_item)
cyber_item4.append_facets(sms_msg)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(cyber_item4)
```

Reporting the identity of a person is done by first creating an _Identity Object_ and appending to it a _Simple Name Facet_, and (if known)
a _Birthday Information Facet_.

```python
identity = uco.identity.Identity()
identity_name = uco.identity.FacetSimpleName(given_name="Forename", family_name="Family-name")
identity_birth = uco.identity.FacetBirthInformation(birthdate="01-01-1988")
identity.append_facets(identity_birth, identity_name)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(identity)
```

To report a location, create a _Location Object_ and append to it a _Location Facet_.

```python
location1 = uco.location.Location()
lat_long = uco.location.FacetLocation(latitude=61.185055, longitude=9.468836)
location1.append_facets(lat_long)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(location1)
```

Finally, an _Investigation Object_ is being created where the `investigation actions` performed are being reported throught the
`core_objects` parameter.

```python
investigation = case.investigation.CaseInvestigation(focus="Transfer of Illicit Materials",
                                                     name="Crime A",
                                                     description="Inquiry into the transfer of illicit materials and "
                                                                 "the devices used to do so",
                                                     core_objects=investigation_items)
bundle.append_to_uco_object(investigation)
```
