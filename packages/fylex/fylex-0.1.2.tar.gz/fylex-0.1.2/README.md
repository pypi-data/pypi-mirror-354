# fylex

**Smart, Fast & Customizable File Copier**  
A Python-based file copying utility with hashing, filtering, multi-threading, and intelligent conflict resolution. Designed for developers, data engineers, and power users.

##
##  What is `fylex`?

`fylex` is a command-line tool and Python module that simplifies and enhances the task of copying files and directories. Unlike standard copy tools, `fylex` offers powerful filtering options, safe hashing to avoid redundant operations, multi-threaded execution for performance, and customizable conflict handling strategies.


##  Features with Examples


### 1. **Hash-Based Copying (xxHash)**

Files are compared using **fast checksums** to avoid copying files that already exist unchanged.

**Example:**
```bash
fylex --src ./project --dest ./backup
````

If files in `project/` already exist in `backup/` with the same content, `fylex` skips them.

##

### 2. **File Filtering with Regex and Glob**

#### ðŸ”¹ Include only `.txt` files using glob:

```bash
fylex --match-glob '*.txt' --src ./src --dest ./dest
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Use regex to copy only files with digits:

```bash
fylex --match-regex '.*\d+.*\.txt$' --src ./logs --dest ./data
```

#### ðŸ”¹ Exclude by filename list:

```bash
fylex --exclude-names temp.txt,debug.log --src ./src --dest ./dest
```

Combine multiple filters to fine-tune your selection.

##

### 3. **Conflict Resolution Modes**

Specify what happens if a file with the same name already exists at the destination:

| Mode    | Description                          |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| replace | Overwrite the existing file          |
| skip    | Skip copying this file               |
| rename  | Create a new name like `file(1).txt` |
| newer   | Keep the newest version              |
| older   | Keep the older version               |
| larger  | Keep the larger file                 |
| smaller | Keep the smaller file                |
| prompt  | Ask the user what to do              |

**Example (rename on conflict):**

```bash
fylex --on-conflict rename --src ./files --dest ./archive
```

##

### 4. **Interactive Mode**

Prompts the user before copying each file. Ideal when you need precise control.

```bash
fylex --interactive --src ./important --dest ./external_drive
```

##

### 5. **Dry Run Mode**

Simulates the entire copy process without actually moving files. Very useful for testing.

```bash
fylex --dry-run --src ./project --dest ./backup
```

Output will show which files would be copied or skipped, without changing anything.

##

###  6. **Multithreaded Copying**

Use all available CPU cores (or specify how many) to speed up the copying of many files.

```bash
fylex --max-workers 8 --src ./bigdata --dest ./transfer
```

##

###  7. **(File-Based) Copying with Custom Folder Support**

`fylex` currently operates on **files only** â€” directories themselves are **not copied recursively** by default.

However, users can easily walk through directories using Python and pass files to `fylex` programmatically.

#### Example: Recursively Copy an Entire Directory Tree

You can combine `fylex.smart_copy()` with Pythonâ€™s `os.walk()` to copy all files while preserving the directory structure:

```python
import os
from fylex import smart_copy

src_root = "./mydir"
dest_root = "./backup"

for root, _, files in os.walk(src_root):
    for file in files:
        abs_src_dir = root
        rel_path = os.path.relpath(root, src_root)
        dest_dir = os.path.join(dest_root, rel_path)

        smart_copy(
            src=abs_src_dir,
            dest=dest_dir,
            match_names=[file],
            on_conflict="rename",  # or 'skip', 'prompt', etc.
            interactive=False,
            max_workers=4
        )
```

This allows `fylex` to:

* Walk through all nested directories
* Preserve folder structure
* Avoid unnecessary copies using hash-based checks
* Apply your desired conflict strategy

> In future releases, native support for recursive directory copying will be included.

##

###  8. **Preserve File Metadata**

`fylex` uses `shutil.copy2()` which retains:

* Access/modification times
* File permissions (on Unix)
* File ownership (when permitted)

This is done **automatically** â€” no flags needed.

##

###  9. **Logging and Summary Files**

Enable verbose logging to console, and optionally save logs to a file.

```bash
fylex --verbose --summary logs/summary.log --src ./src --dest ./dest
```

This generates a human-readable log with all actions taken by `fylex`.

##  Why fylex Might Be the Best in Market
âœ” Combines glob, regex, and name filtering â€” most tools support only one.

âœ” Detects duplicates based on content hashing, not metadata.

âœ” Re-hashes and verifies the copies to ensure data integrity.

âœ” Conflict resolution goes **beyond overwrite/skip** â€” with logic-based decisions.

âœ” No platform lock-in â€” works on **Linux**, **Windows**, and **macOS**.

âœ” Clean API structure for future expansion (GUI, networking, etc.)

âœ” Practical logging and dry-run mode â€” rarely seen in open-source file tools.

âœ” Performance boost via parallel threads and fast hashing.
