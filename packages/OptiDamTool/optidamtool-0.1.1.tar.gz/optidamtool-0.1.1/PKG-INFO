`OptiDamTool` is a Python package designed for analytics and decision-making in dam management. Conceptualized and released on May 29, 2025, the package offers tools for modeling and analyzing hydrological flow across a network of connected dams.


Leveraging functionalities from the open-source [GeoAnalyze](https://github.com/debpal/GeoAnalyze) package, `OptiDamTool` provides classes that that assist users in preparing inputs for simulating water erosion and sediment transport, and supports decision-making in dam network deployment aimed at environmental sustainability.

## Classes

### `OptiDamTool.WatemSedem` 
Provides methods to prepare inputs for simulating the 
[WaTEM/SEDEM](https://github.com/watem-sedem) model, which predicts soil erosion, sediment transport capacity, and sediment delivery to stream networks at the watershed scale.  This class currently provides the following feature:

* Converts Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data into the stream files required for the WaTEM/SEDEM model, with the `river routing = 1` extension enabled.
* Generates effective upstream drainage polygons for selected dam locations within a stream network.


### `OptiDamTool.Network` 
Offers methods for establishing hydrological and sedimentation flow connectivity between dams using the stream network. This class currently provides the following feature:

* Identifies connectivity between adjacent upstream and downstream dams.
* Computes the effective upstream drainage area values for selected dam locations within a stream network.


## Easy Installation

To install, use pip:

```bash
pip install OptiDamTool
```


## Quickstart
A brief example of how to start:

```python
>>> import OptiDamTool
>>> watemsedem = OptiDamTool.WatemSedem()
>>> network = OptiDamTool.Network()
```
