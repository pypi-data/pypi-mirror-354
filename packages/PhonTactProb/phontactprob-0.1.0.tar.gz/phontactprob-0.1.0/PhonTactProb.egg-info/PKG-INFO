# Phonotactic Analyzer

A lightweight Python package for computing phonotactic probabilities using IPA-transcribed input. Defaults to the nltk Brown Corpus (Francis, W. N., & Kuƒçera, H.,1964). Ideal for phonological research, computational linguistics, or linguistic data analysis. Uses the methodology described by Vitevitch & Luce (2004).

## üöÄ Features

- Tokenizes IPA input and returns phonotactic probabilities using frequencies computed from the Brown corpus
- Functions are all modular so they should work for a self provided corpus and dictionary entries.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
