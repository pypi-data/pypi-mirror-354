A lightweight Python package for computing phonotactic probabilities using IPA-transcribed input. Defaults to the nltk Brown Corpus (Francis, W. N., & Kučera, H.,1964). Ideal for phonological research, computational linguistics, or linguistic data analysis. Uses the methodology described by Vitevitch & Luce (2004).
