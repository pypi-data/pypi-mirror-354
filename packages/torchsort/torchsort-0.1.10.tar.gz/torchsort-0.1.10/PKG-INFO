           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# Torchsort

![Tests](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

Fast, differentiable sorting and ranking in PyTorch.

Pure PyTorch implementation of [Fast Differentiable Sorting and
Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08871) (Blondel et al.). Much of the code is
copied from the original Numpy implementation at
[google-research/fast-soft-sort](https://github.com/google-research/fast-soft-sort),
with the isotonic regression solver rewritten as a PyTorch C++ and CUDA
extension.

## Install

```bash
pip install torchsort
```

To build the CUDA extension you will need the CUDA toolchain installed. If you
want to build in an environment without a CUDA runtime (e.g. docker), you will
need to export the environment variable
`TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="Pascal;Volta;Turing;Ampere"` before installing.

<details>
<summary><strong>Conda Installation</strong></summary>
On some systems the package my not compile with `pip` install in conda
environments. If this happens you may need to:
    
 1. Install g++ with `conda install -c conda-forge gxx_linux-64=9.40`
 2. Run `export CXX=/path/to/miniconda3/envs/env_name/bin/x86_64-conda_cos6-linux-gnu-g++`
 3. Run `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/miniconda3/lib`
 4. `pip install --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir --no-deps torchsort`

Thanks to @levnikmyskin, @sachit-menon for pointing this out!

# 2.6, 2.5, 2.4, 2.1, 2.0, and 1.13 respectively
export TORCH=pt26
# CUDA version, supports cpu, cu113, cu117, cu118, cu121, cu124, and cu126 for
# CPU-only, CUDA 11.3, CUDA 11.7, CUDA 11.8, CUDA 12.1, CUDA 12.4, and CUDA 12.6
# respectively
export CUDA=cu126
# Python version, supports cp310, cp311, and cp312 for versions 3.10, 3.11, and
# 3.12 respectively
export PYTHON=cp312

pip install https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/releases/download/v${TORCHSORT}/torchsort-${TORCHSORT}+${TORCH}${CUDA}-${PYTHON}-${PYTHON}-linux_x86_64.whl
```

Thanks to [siddharthab](https://github.com/siddharthab) for the help creating the build action! See the [latest release](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/releases/latest) for a list of supported combinations in *Assets*.

## Usage

`torchsort` exposes two functions: `soft_rank` and `soft_sort`, each with
parameters `regularization` (`"l2"` or `"kl"`) and `regularization_strength` (a
scalar value). Each will rank/sort the last dimension of a 2-d tensor, with an
accuracy dependent upon the regularization strength:

```python
import torch
import torchsort

x = torch.tensor([[8, 0, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6, 7, 9]])

torchsort.soft_sort(x, regularization_strength=1.0)
# tensor([[0.5556, 1.5556, 2.5556, 3.5556, 4.5556, 5.5556, 6.5556, 7.5556, 8.5556]])
torchsort.soft_sort(x, regularization_strength=0.1)
# tensor([[-0., 1., 2., 3., 5., 6., 7., 8., 9.]])

torchsort.soft_rank(x)
# tensor([[8., 1., 5., 4., 3., 2., 6., 7., 9.]])
```

Both operations are fully differentiable, on CPU or GPU:

```python
x = torch.tensor([[8., 0., 5., 3., 2., 1., 6., 7., 9.]], requires_grad=True).cuda()
y = torchsort.soft_sort(x)

torch.autograd.grad(y[0, 0], x)
# (tensor([[0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111, 0.1111]],
#         device='cuda:0'),)
```

## Example

### Spearman's Rank Coefficient

[Spearman's rank
coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient)
is a very useful metric for measuring how monotonically related two variables
are. We can use Torchsort to create a differentiable Spearman's rank coefficient
function so that we can optimize a model directly for this metric:

```python
import torch
import torchsort

def spearmanr(pred, target, **kw):
    pred = torchsort.soft_rank(pred, **kw)
    target = torchsort.soft_rank(target, **kw)
    pred = pred - pred.mean()
    pred = pred / pred.norm()
    target = target - target.mean()
    target = target / target.norm()
    return (pred * target).sum()

pred = torch.tensor([[1., 2., 3., 4., 5.]], requires_grad=True)
target = torch.tensor([[5., 6., 7., 8., 7.]])
spearman = spearmanr(pred, target)
# tensor(0.8321)

torch.autograd.grad(spearman, pred)
# (tensor([[-5.5470e-02,  2.9802e-09,  5.5470e-02,  1.1094e-01, -1.1094e-01]]),)
```

## Benchmark

![Benchmark](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/raw/main/extra/benchmark.png)

`torchsort` and `fast_soft_sort` each operate with a time complexity of *O(n log
n)*, each with some additional overhead when compared to the built-in
`torch.sort`. With a batch size of 1 (see left), the Numba JIT'd forward pass of
`fast_soft_sort` performs about on-par with the `torchsort` CPU kernel, however
its backward pass still relies on some Python code, which greatly penalizes its
performance. 

Furthermore, the `torchsort` kernel supports batches, and yields much better
performance than `fast_soft_sort` as the batch size increases.

![Benchmark](https://github.com/teddykoker/torchsort/raw/main/extra/benchmark_cuda.png)

The `torchsort` CUDA kernel performs quite well with sequence lengths under
~2000, and scales to extremely large batch sizes. In the future the
CUDA kernel can likely be further optimized to achieve performance closer to that of the
built in `torch.sort`.
