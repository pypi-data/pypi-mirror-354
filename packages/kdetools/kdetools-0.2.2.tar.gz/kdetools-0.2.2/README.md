# kdetools
Some useful tools for working with Kernel Density Estimates (KDEs) built on top of the `scipy` Gaussian KDE code. Currently includes a subclass of `scipy.stats.gaussian_kde` with an additional method (`conditional_resample`) for conditional random sampling from a multivariate KDE and cross-validation based bandwidth estimators, and a new class (`kdecdf`) for vectorised 1D KDE fitting for multiple variables and conversion to smoothed empirical CDFs.
