    sort_indices        Permutation vector such that Vsort = V[:, sort_indices]


    `sign_flip_vector` is such that `Vor = V diag(sign_flip_vector)`, i.e. Vor is an oriented basis

    V                   Eigenvector matrix with columns vectors
    E                   Eigenvalue matrix conformant to V



    notes:

    1. The columns of `Vor` are ordered such that their associated eigenvalues are sorted in descending order of
       absolute value. That the absolute value is taken on the eigenvalues is to treat the general case of an input
       Hermitian matrix. For data analysis, SVD will generally yield a positive (semi)definite eigensystem, so negative
       eigenvalues are not attained.

    2. The diagonal entries of `Eor` are ordered in descending absolute value of the input eigenvalue matrix `E`.

def generate_oriented_eigenvectors(angles2D:matrix, kth_eigenvector) -> matrix:
    '''
    answers R, the rotation matrix

    where:

    angles2D            upper-triangular (n x n) matrix of angles
    kth_eigenvector     base(1) index of the eigenvector to rotate into its constituent axis


    The call `orientEigenvectors` consumes an eigenvector matrix `V` that is not necessarily oriented and
    returns `Vor`, its oriented counterpart. The `orientEigenvectors` call also returns `angles2D`.

    This function consumes `angles2D` (instead of `V`) to produce `Vor`, the oriented eigenvector matrix.

    Recall that

    (1)    Vor = V S = R

    where `S` is a diagonal matrix with +/- 1 entries, and `R` is a rotation matrix. `orientEigenvectors` computes
    `V S` while this function computes `R`.

    For a constituent basis I(n), the identity matrix, `R` rotates `I` into `Vor`,

    (2)    Vor = R I

    In this way we identify `R` with the rotation that brings `I` into alignment with `Vor`.

    Rotation matrix `R` itself is a cascade of rotations, one for each eigenvector,

    (3)    R = R_1 R_2 ... R_n

    Moreover, rotation R_k is itself a cascade of elemental Givens rotations. In R^4, the R_1 rotation is

    (4)    R_1(theta_(1,2), theta_(1,3), theta_(1,4)) =
                R_(1,2)(theta_(1,2))
                    x R_(1,3)(theta_(1,3))
                        x R_(1,4)(theta_(1,4))

    The angles are read from `angles2D` such that

              -                  -
              | 0  t12  t13  t14 |  <-- row for R_1
    ang_mtx = |    0    t23  t24 |  <-- row for R_2
              |    *    0    t34 |   ..
              |    *    *    0   |
              -                  -


    notes:

    The full dimension of the space, `n`, is inferred from the dimension of `angles2D`. Given `n`, the
    rotation matrix that corresponds to the kth eigenvector is constructed from elementary Givens rotations. In
    R^4, the rotation matrix for the 1st eigenvector is

    (1) R_1(theta_(1,2), theta_(1,3), theta_(1,4)) = R_(1,2)(theta_(1,2)) x R_(1,3)(theta_(1,3)) x R_(1,4)(theta_(1,4))

    The rotation matrix for the full eigenbasis in R^4 is

    (2) R = R_1 R_2 R_3 R_4

    Solves for embedded angles necessary to rotate a unit vector pointing along the `cursor` axis, within `n`,

    Recursive solution strategy to calculate rotation angles required to rotate the principal axis of a sub dimension
    onto an axis of its corresponding constituent basis.

    notes:

    The recursion in this function solves for angles theta_2, theta_3, ... such that:
