# üéº AgentOrchestrator (AGOR)

**Multi-Agent Development Coordination Platform**

Transform AI assistants into sophisticated development coordinators. Plan complex projects, design specialized agent teams, and orchestrate coordinated development workflows.

**Supports**: Linux, macOS, Windows | **Primary Platforms**: ChatGPT, AugmentCode, Google AI Studio

> **üî¨ Alpha Protocol**: AGOR coordination strategies are actively evolving based on real-world usage. [Contribute feedback](https://github.com/jeremiah-k/agor/issues) to help shape AI coordination patterns.

> **üöß Under Construction**: We're still figuring out what works and what doesn't for the dev tooling, so be warned some functionality might be broken.

## üöÄ Installation & Deployment

AGOR supports multiple deployment modes for different AI platforms and workflows. Choose the approach that matches your environment:

**üì¶ Bundle Mode** - Upload-based platforms - Google AI Studio, ChatGPT (not Codex)
**üöÄ Standalone Mode** - Direct git access - AugmentCode Remote, Jules by Google (limited support), Codex (currently untested)
**üè† Local Integration** - Workspace integration (AugmentCode Local Agent)

AGOR facilitates AI-driven development through a distinct set of interactions. While the name "Orchestrator" suggests a multi-agent focus, AGOR's robust protocols for structured work, context management (especially via its snapshot capabilities), and tool integration are highly valuable even for **solo developers**. These interactions include: commands for developers using the AGOR CLI (e.g., `agor bundle`), conversational hotkeys for AI-user collaboration (e.g., `sp`, `edit`), and internal tools (like a bundled `git`) used directly by the AI agent. Understanding these layers is key to leveraging AGOR effectively, whether working alone or in a team.

## üîÑ Operational Modes

AGOR enhances the original AgentGrunt capabilities by offering two primary operational modes with improved multi-agent coordination and flexible deployment options:

### üöÄ Standalone Mode (Direct Git Access)

**For agents with repository access** (AugmentCode Remote Agents, Jules by Google, etc.)

- **Direct commits**: Agents can make commits directly if they have commit access
- **Fallback method**: Copy-paste codeblocks if no commit access
- **Full git operations**: Branch creation, merging, pull requests
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multiple agents working on live repositories
- **No file size limits**: Complete repository access

### üì¶ Bundled Mode (Upload-Based Platforms)

**For upload-based platforms** (Google AI Studio, ChatGPT, etc.)

- **Copy-paste workflow**: Users manually copy edited files from agent output
- **Manual commits**: Users handle git operations themselves
- **Platform flexibility**: Works with any AI platform that accepts file uploads
- **Free tier compatible**: Excellent for Google AI Studio Pro (free)

> **üí° Key Point**: All AGOR roles (Worker Agent, Project Coordinator) function effectively in both Standalone and Bundled modes. The primary difference lies in how code changes are applied: direct Git commits are possible in Standalone Mode (if the agent has access), while Bundled Mode typically relies on a copy-paste workflow where the user handles the final commit.

## üéØ Core Capabilities & Features

### Role-Based Workflows

AGOR defines distinct roles to structure AI-driven development tasks. Each role is equipped with a specialized set of tools and designed for specific types of activities:

**üîπ Worker Agent**: Focuses on deep codebase analysis, implementation, and answering technical questions. Ideal for solo development tasks, feature implementation, and detailed debugging.

**üîπ PROJECT COORDINATOR**: Handles strategic planning, designs multi-agent workflows, and orchestrates team activities. Best suited for multi-agent project planning, strategy design, and overall team coordination.

**üîπ AGENT WORKER**: Executes specific tasks assigned by a Project Coordinator and participates in coordinated work snapshots. Primarily used for task execution within a team and following established multi-agent workflows.

### Multi-Agent Strategies

- **Parallel Divergent**: Independent exploration ‚Üí peer review ‚Üí synthesis
- **Pipeline**: Sequential snapshots with specialization
- **Swarm**: Dynamic task assignment for maximum parallelism
- **Red Team**: Adversarial build/break cycles for robustness
- **Mob Programming**: Collaborative coding with rotating roles

### Key Development Tools

- **Git integration** with portable binary (works in any environment)
- **Codebase analysis** with language-specific exploration
- **Memory persistence** with markdown files and git branch synchronization
- **Mandatory snapshot system** for context preservation and agent transitions
- **Quality gates** and validation checkpoints
- **Structured Snapshot Protocols** (for multi-agent coordination and solo context management)

## üìä Hotkey Interface
