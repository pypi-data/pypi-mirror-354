"""
Concrete Test Spy for the `API` Interface using Enhanced Spying.

This module provides `ApiSpy`, a specific implementation of the **Test Spy
pattern** tailored for the `crudclient.api.API` interface. It utilizes
the `EnhancedSpyBase` and `ClassSpy` mechanisms to record and verify
interactions made with the API component, such as endpoint registration.

    A **Test Spy** specifically for the `crudclient.api.API` interface.

    This class acts as a test double that conforms to the `API` interface but
    also inherits from `EnhancedSpyBase` to record method calls made to it
    (primarily `register_endpoint`). It uses composition internally, wrapping a
    concrete `API` subclass instance and spying on its methods using `ClassSpy`.

    Tests can use the verification methods inherited from `EnhancedSpyBase` or
    the dedicated `Verifier` class (`crudclient.testing.verification.Verifier`)
    to assert how the API was interacted with. Custom verification methods
    specific to API interactions are also provided.
