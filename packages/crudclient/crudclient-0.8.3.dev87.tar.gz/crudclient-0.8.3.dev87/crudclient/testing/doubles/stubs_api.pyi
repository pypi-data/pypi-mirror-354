    """
    A stub implementation of the API class for testing, managing multiple stubbed endpoints.

    This class facilitates testing scenarios involving multiple related API resources
    by providing a way to register `StubCrud` instances for different endpoints,
    all potentially sharing a common underlying `StubClient` and a shared, partitioned
    in-memory data store.

    Attributes:
        client_class: The class to use for the client (defaults to `crudclient.Client`).
                      Can be set to `StubClient` for full stubbing.
        endpoints: A dictionary mapping registered endpoint names to their `StubCrud` instances.
        _data_store: A dictionary holding the data for all registered endpoints,
                     partitioned by endpoint name. The structure is:
                     `{endpoint_name: {resource_id: resource_dict}}`.
