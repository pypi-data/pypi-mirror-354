Concrete Test Spy for the `Client` Interface using Enhanced Spying.

This module provides `ClientSpy`, a specific implementation of the **Test Spy
pattern** tailored for the `crudclient.client.Client` interface. It utilizes
the `EnhancedSpyBase` and `ClassSpy` mechanisms to record and verify
interactions made directly with the client component.

    A **Test Spy** specifically for the `crudclient.client.Client` interface.

    This class acts as a test double that conforms to the `Client` interface but
    also inherits from `EnhancedSpyBase` to record all method calls made to it
    (e.g., `get`, `post`, `put`). It uses composition internally, wrapping a
    real `Client` instance and spying on its methods using `ClassSpy`.

    Tests can use the verification methods inherited from `EnhancedSpyBase` or
    the dedicated `Verifier` class (`crudclient.testing.verification.Verifier`)
    to assert how the client was interacted with. Custom verification methods
    specific to client interactions are also provided.
