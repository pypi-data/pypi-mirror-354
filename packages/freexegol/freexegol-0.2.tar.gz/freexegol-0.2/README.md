## Introduction

**Freexegol** is the free, open-source, and lifetime alternative to the Exegol project  
(actually, it's a crappy project but it's free for commercial use!)

---

### Disclaimer

This project is **not** intended to overshadow the amazing [Exegol project](https://exegol.com), which we greatly appreciate and recommend.  
However, since Exegol is no longer free for commercial use, **Freexegol** exists only to provide a minimalist, usable, and truly free alternative for commercial contexts.
