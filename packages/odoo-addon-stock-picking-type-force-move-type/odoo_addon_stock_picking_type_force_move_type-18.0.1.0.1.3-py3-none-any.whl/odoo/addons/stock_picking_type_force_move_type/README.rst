By default Odoo takes the Shipping Policy set in the procurement group,
or fallbacks on the one configured on the Operation Type.

This module adds a Force Shipping Policy field on Operations Types to
ensure transfers will take the policy according to their types, ignoring
the one set on the Procurement Group.

This is especially useful if you use a multi-steps setup (like
pick-pack-ship) and you want the pick and/or pack operation to wait for
all goods to be available no matter what was the sales shipping policy.
