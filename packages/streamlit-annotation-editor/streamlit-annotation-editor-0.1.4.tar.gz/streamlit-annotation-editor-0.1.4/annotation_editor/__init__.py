    Parameters
    ----------
    annotation_data: list of AnnotationData
        A list of AnnotationData objects that define the text and the
        annotations for the component. Each AnnotationData object must
        contain a "text" key with the text to be annotated and an "annotations"
        key with a list of Annotation objects. Each Annotation object
        must contain a "start" key with the start index of the annotation, an
        "end" key with the end index of the annotation, an "entityType" key
        with the entity type of the annotation, an optional "confidence_score"
        key with the confidence score of the annotation and an optional "text"
        key with the text of the annotation. The "entityType" key can be a
        string or an EntityType object. If it is a string, the entity type
        must be one of the entity types defined in the "entity_types" argument.
        The "confidence_score" key should be a float between 0 and 1. The
        "text" key will replace the text of the annotation in the component.
    entity_types: list of EntityType
        A list of EntityType objects that define the entity types that can be
        highlighted. Each EntityType object must contain a "name" key with the
        name of the entity type, a "primary_color" key with the primary color
        of the entity type and an optional "secondary_color" key with the
        secondary color of the entity type.
    key: str or None
        An optional key that uniquely identifies this component. If this is
        None, and the component's arguments are changed, the component will
        be re-mounted in the Streamlit frontend and lose its current state.
