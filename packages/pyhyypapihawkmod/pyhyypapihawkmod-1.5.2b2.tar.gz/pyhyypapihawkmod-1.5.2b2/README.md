This is a fork from https://github.com/RenierM26. This fork has reversed engineered the protobuf pb2 files and recompiled with version 4.21. This fixes the issues on newer versions of home assistant and incorporated several new features. See the main integration: https://github.com/hawky358/hass_ids_hyyp for more information.




# pyHyypApi

**Note** this Api is built to work with the IDS Hyyp integration for home assistant (https://github.com/hawky358/hass_ids_hyyp).  No usage instruction is currently provided.

API for ADT Secure Home and IDS Hyyp. There could be more variants but it's easy to add package names to the constants.py file.


Changelog 

1.5.2b1
- Initial fix for unexpected exceptions in Home assistant. Changed handling to be a friendlier message in HASS due to unreliable responses from IDS servers.

1.5.1
- Reworked FCM system, now using [firebase messaging](https://github.com/sdb9696/firebase-messaging) as the main handler for FCM communication with google.
- Various improvements to the error handling of the new FCM system to allow for cleaner reconnects and renewal of credentials.

1.3.6
- Updated alarm_info_push_timer() method to have a "onetime" paramater. This allows you to get a once off "forced" update from IDS at any time by using the initialize_alarm_info_push_timer() method with the onetime parameter set to true

- Fixed high cpu usage infinite loop
- Added full restart callback for notification system
- Added connectivity check and better reconnect system when internet is lost.

1.3.1
- Released 1.3.1 with push receiver system
- Further heartbeat optimization
- Added exception for ping

1.3.0b8

1.3.0b1
- API supports both push and poll mode.
- API will can now send to Home Assistant when data is ready instead of Home assistant Polling
- Relevant new methods:
  - `request_alarm_info_push_to_hass()` - Hass can call this to request an earlier push instead of the 30 seconds
  - `initialize_alarm_info_push_timer()` - Hass must call this when ready as it initializes the timer in the API
  - `register_alarm_info_callback()` - Hass muss register a callback method using this method
