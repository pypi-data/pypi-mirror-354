<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Usage

nbs2ctx is a minimal CLI for turning a directory of notebooks (e.g.Â an
NBDev project) into context for an LLM. For example, from the root dir
of this github repo we could run:

`nbs_to_ctx nbs ctx.xml`

This will create a file ctx.xml with the contents of all the notebooks
in the nbs folder.

    <documents>
    <document index="1">
    <source>00_core.ipynb</source>
    <document_content>
    # nbs_to_ctx

    &gt; Turning Jupyter notebooks into LLM-ready context

    ```python
    #| default_exp core
    ... and so on, with the full contents of the notebook
