    Return first file found in a search path of directories.

    This function implements ideas covered in a discussion page for mspass.
    (#641 found here:  https://github.com/mspass-team/mspass/discussions/641).
    Main idea is to provide a robust search for a stock data file.
    Algorithm first searches for the first occurence of the file in the
    `dirs` list.  If it doesn't find it any directory listed there it
    tests the `try_mspass_home` boolean.  If that is set it tries to
    retrieve the environment variable MSPASS_HOME and searches the
    same dir list with MSPASS_HOME as the top level in a path.
    Returns a path.  A None return means it failed.

    :param filename:  file name to search for
    :type filename:  string (no default - required arg)
    :param format:  expected format of filename.  Note the function is pedantic
      about file names and with raise a ValueError exception of the file name is
      inconsistent with format.  Currenly accepts two format:  (a) "yaml" in which
      case filename is required to end with ".yaml" or ".yml".   (b) "pf" in which
      case the file name must end in ".pf".  Actual tests use os.path and pull the
      "file extension" part of the filename.
    :type format:  str - must be one of "yaml" or "pf" or a ValueError exception
       will be raised.
    :param dirs:  list paths to search for filename
    :type dirs:  list of str
    :param try_mspass_home:  boolean handling fallback search as described above.
       That is, if filename is not found in the dirs list the search over dirs
       is repeated with a lead value of MSPASS_HOME (if defined)
