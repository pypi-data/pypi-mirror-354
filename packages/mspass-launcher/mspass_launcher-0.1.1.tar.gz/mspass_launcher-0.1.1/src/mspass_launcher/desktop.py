This file containa a main program that creates and uses a GUI for
launching and controlling MsPASS in a desktop environment.

Usage:
    mspass [-f configfile]

where configfile is an alternative configuration file for the launcher and
GUI.   The default uses one found in the default $MSPASSHOME/data/yaml
diretory called mspass_launcher.yaml.

class MsPASSDesktopCluster:
    """
    Class to manage an instance of MsPASS with docker compose.

    This class provides the "engine" used within the MsPASSDesktopGUI.
    All the GUI code is then isolated to that class that uses this one.
    The class creates and manages an instance of  MsPASS cluster
    using docker compose.   Because docker compose is a command line
    tool most of the methods use the python subprocess.run function
    to run appropriate docker compose incantations.

    The configuration of the cluster is driven by a yaml file loaded
    by the constructor.  That file should be a lightly edited version
    of the master stored in this repository in the file
    data/yaml/MsPASSDesktopCluster.yaml.  In particular, the yaml
    file must define four services run in four launches of the docker
    container with the tags:  mspass-db, mspass-fronend, mspass-scheduler,
    and mspass-worker.

    Because the primary purpose of this class is to encapsulate an
    abstraction of a running MsPASS cluster for the GUI, only user's
    interested in modifying the GUI will likely need to ever examine
    this class.

        Constructor for this class.

        The constructor currently does only one thing which is to
        load the configuration file name.   The main initializations
        are done in the launch_cluster method.  That violates the
        normal OOP rule of "construction is initialization" but
        is appropriate for this application.  The reason is that
        the GUI creates an instance of this class on startup but
        doesn't run the launch_cluster method until the "launch"
        button is pressed by the user.  That was done to create a
        more intuitive gui where when it first launches the only
        active part of the gui is the launch button.  Once the
        launch button is active other actions possible.

        Emphasize the only thing loaded is a file name.  The complexity
        is it uses a rule-based search for data files that allows the
        yaml configuration file to be stored other than in the current
