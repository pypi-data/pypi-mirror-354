title: More customization
---

This page details 3 common aspects of quartodoc you can extend:

* The reference index page generated (which lists all your functions).
* The way docstrings are renderered.
* The overall building process.


## Using a custom index page

Use a custom index page to add content before or after the automatically generated
API index.

You can do this by setting quartodoc's `out_index` to be something other than `index.qmd`,
and then including it in a custom `index.qmd` file.

First, set `out_index` in your `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    left:
      - file: reference/index.qmd
        text: Reference

quartodoc:
  dir: reference
  out_index: reference/_api_index.qmd
```

Then, create the file `reference/index.qmd` to have the form:

```bash
---
---

Some custom content.


{{{< include /reference/_api_index.qmd >}}}


More content stuff.
```

Notice that the shortcode `{{< include ... >}}` is used to insert the index file generated
by quartodoc (`_api_index.qmd`).


## Using a custom Renderer

Use a custom renderer to add custom content after a renderered docstring, or
to change the rendering process in general.

You can do this by creating a custom file for your renderer in your docs folder, like `_renderer.py`,
and then referencing it in your `_quarto.yml`.

```yaml
quartodoc:
  renderer:
    style: _renderer.py
```

See the [Rendering docstrings](/get-started/renderers.qmd) page for instructions on
creating a custom renderer, and the [](`quartodoc.MdRenderer`) docs for more information.

## Using a custom Builder

Since the Builder controls the full quartodoc build process, using a custom builder
provides total flexibility. This option currently isn't available, but would be easy
to enable.

Please leave a note on [this issue](https://github.com/machow/quartodoc/issues/34) if you
need to use a custom builder.
