quartodoc prefers numpy style for docstrings, but can support other styles by configuring parser in your [quartodoc site options](./basic-docs.qmd) of `_quarto.yml`:

```yaml
quartodoc:
  parser: google
```

Currently, google, sphinx, and numpy are supported. Parsing is handled by the tool [griffe](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/griffe).
