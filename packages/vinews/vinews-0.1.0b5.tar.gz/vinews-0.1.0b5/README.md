## Responsible Scraping ‼️

Please be respectful of the websites you interact with. Always use appropriate rate limiting and avoid sending excessive requests.

from vinews.modules.vnexpress.search import VinewsVnExpressSearch
import asyncio
import json

search_engine = VinewsVnExpressSearch()
query = "Bitcoin"
    
# Test synchronous search
results = search_engine.search(query=query, date_range="day", category="kinhdoanh", limit=5, advanced=True)
print(results)

homepage = search_engine.search_homepage()
print(homepage)    

def vinews_async():
    # Test asynchronous search
    async def async_test():
        async_results = await search_engine.async_search(query=query, date_range="day", category="kinhdoanh", limit=5, advanced=True)
        
        async_homepage = await search_engine.async_search_homepage()

        # Optional saving
        with open("tests/output/vnexpress_search.json", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            json.dump(async_results.model_dump(), f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
