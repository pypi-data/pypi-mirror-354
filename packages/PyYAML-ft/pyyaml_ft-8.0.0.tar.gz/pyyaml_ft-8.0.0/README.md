PyYAML-ft
=========

A full-featured YAML processing framework for Python with support for free-threading

## Why a fork?

[PEP 703](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/) introduced free-threaded Python as a
separate build of CPython 3.13. Thread-safety issues that might have otherwise gone
unnoticed are now much easier to trigger because of the absence of protection from
the GIL. Also, because the free-threaded build is ABI-incompatible, extension
modules need to be separate, free-threaded wheels and declare support for
it.

The PyYAML maintainers
[decided to not port PyYAML to the free-threaded build](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/pull/830#issuecomment-2342475334)
before the latter, along with Cython support for it, has been tested more extensively
in real-world applications. Our rationale with this fork is to implement support for
the free-threaded build, so that PyYAML can be tested with it by its users, even before
the port is merged upstream.

### Differences compared with upstream

- This fork uses Cython 3.1 which supports the free-threaded build, but whose support
  is still experimental.
- `add_constructor`, `add_representer` and `add_*resolver` now all use thread-local
  registries, so you will have to explicitly register your custom constrcutors,
  representers and resolvers in each thread. Here's a small test showcasing that:

  ```python3
  import io
  import threading
  import yaml_ft as yaml


  class Dice:
      def __init__(self, first, second):
          self.first = first
          self.second = second
      def __repr__(self):
          return f"Dice({self.first}, {self.second})"


  def construct_dice(constructor, node):
      mapping = constructor.construct_mapping(node)
      return Dice(**mapping)


  def load_dice():
      yamlcode = io.StringIO("""\
  - !dice
    first: 1
    second: 6
  - !dice
    first: 4
    second: 4
  """)
      print(f"Thread {threading.current_thread().name}")
      try:
          objs = yaml.load(yamlcode, Loader=yaml.CLoader)
          print(f"\t{objs=}")
      except Exception as e:
          print(f"\tException occurred: {e!s}")

  yaml.add_constructor("!dice", construct_dice, Loader=yaml.CLoader)
  load_dice()

  t = threading.Thread(target=load_dice)
  t.start()
  t.join()
  ```

  Running the above script gives the following:

  ```bash
  ‚ùØ python3.13t tmp/t.py
  Thread MainThread
          objs=[Dice(1, 6), Dice(4, 4)]
  Thread Thread-1 (load_dice)
          Exception occurred: could not determine a constructor for the tag '!dice'
    in "<file>", line 1, column 3
  ```

  If you see new errors in multithreaded programs using `PyYAML-ft` that work with
  `PyYAML`, you may need to add calls to `yaml_ft.add_constructor`, `yaml_ft.add_representer`
  `yaml_ft.add_implicit_resolver` or `yaml_ft.add_path_resolver` in your thread worker
  function or worker initialization function.

### Python versions support

Because PyYAML-ft is only aiming to exist for as long as upstream PyYAML
does not support the free-threaded build, we recommend that users only
conditionally switch to PyYAML-ft.

At this time, PyYAML-ft **only supports Python 3.13 and 3.13t (i.e. the
free-threaded build of 3.13)**. To switch to it, you can do the following
in your `requirements.txt` file:

```requirements.txt
...
PyYAML; python_version < '3.13'
PyYAML-ft; python_version >= '3.13'
```

If you're developing a library that depends on PyYAML and you're using
`pyproject.toml` to specify your dependencies, you can do the following:

```toml
dependencies = [
  ...,
  "PyYAML; python_version<'3.13'",
  "PyYAML-ft; python_version>='3.13'",
]
```

### Different module name

PyYAML-ft uses a different module name (namely `yaml_ft`) than upstream PyYAML
on purpose, so that both can be installed in an environment at the same time.

If your library depends on both for different Python versions, you can do
the following for ease of use:

```python
try:
    import yaml_ft as yaml
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    import yaml
```

## Installation

To install, type `pip install PyYAML-ft`.

When LibYAML bindings are installed (enabled by default), you may use the fast
LibYAML-based parser and emitter as follows:

    >>> yaml.load(stream, Loader=yaml.CLoader)
    >>> yaml.dump(data, Dumper=yaml.CDumper)

If you don't trust the input YAML stream, you should use:

    >>> yaml.safe_load(stream)

## Building from source and testing

To build PyYAML-ft from source:

1. Clone [the fork repository](https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/pyyaml-ft) with
   `git clone https://github.com/Quansight-Labs/pyyaml-ft`.
1. Create a new virtual environment with `python3.13 -m venv .venv`.
1. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate your new virtual environment.
1. Run `python3.13 -m pip install .`. This will build PyYAML-ft
   from source and install it in the newly created virtual environment. By default, the
   installation process will try to install the LibYAML bindings as well, but will
   fail silently if it cannot and instead use the pure-Python version.

   To get the latest version of the LibYAML bindings, you can use the `libyaml.sh`
   installation script:

   ```bash
   ./packaging/build/libyaml.sh  # This will install the bindings
   ```

   After the bindings are installed, you can force installing the bindings with the
   following invocation:

   ```bash
   PYYAML_FORCE_CYTHON=1 \
   PYYAML_FORCE_LIBYAML=1 \
   CFLAGS="-Ilibyaml/include" \
   LDFLAGS="-Llibyaml/src/.libs" \
   python -m pip install -v .
   ```

To test PyYAML-ft:

1. Install `pytest` with `python3.13 -m pip install pytest`.
1. Run the tests by just invoking `pytest` in the root directory of the project.
1. Optionally, you can also run the free-threading tests with `pytest-run-parallel`:

   ```bash
   python3.13 -m pip install pytest-run-parallel
   python3.13 -m pytest --parallel-threads=auto --iterations=20 tests/free_threading
   ```
