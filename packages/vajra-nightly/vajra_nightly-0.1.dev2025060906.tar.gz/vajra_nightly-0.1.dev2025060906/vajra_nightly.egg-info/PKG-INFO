The second-wave lean distributed low-latency LLM inference serving engine.

## Setup

### Option 1: Using VS Code Devcontainer

Vajra now supports development using VS Code devcontainers, which provides a consistent, pre-configured development environment:

1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for VS Code
3. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/project-vajra/vajra
   ```
4. Open the repository in VS Code
5. VS Code will detect the devcontainer configuration and prompt you to reopen the project in a container. Click "Reopen in Container".
6. If you want to use a subset of GPUs, update the `--gpus` flag in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
7. The devcontainer will set up the environment with all dependencies automatically
8. Use VS Code's built-in build tasks (Terminal > Run Build Task...) to easily run common Vajra commands like build, test, and lint directly from the IDE

### Option 2: Manual Setup

#### Setup CUDA

Vajra has been tested with CUDA 12.6 on A100 and H100 GPUs.

#### Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/project-vajra/vajra
```

#### Create mamba environment

Setup mamba if you don't already have it,

```sh
wget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh # follow the instructions from there
```

Create a Python 3.12 environment with cmake,

```sh
mamba env create -f environment-dev.yml -p ./env
```

Activate the environment,

```sh
mamba activate ./env
```

#### Install Vajra

```sh
make build
```

### Incremental C++ Builds

To perform incremental native builds only (for faster incremental builds):

```sh
make build/native
```

If you haven't added any new files, you can also use, which skips the cmake configuration step,

```sh
make build/native_incremental
```

### Linting & formatting

For linting code,

```sh
make lint
```

You can simplify life by performing auto-formatting,

```sh
make format
```

### Running Test

```
make test
```
