# Vajra Documentation


The landscape of artificial intelligence is undergoing a seismic shift. We are moving beyond AI that assists to AI that understands, reasons, and acts with increasing autonomy. This next generation â€” characterized by long-term memory, multimodal perception, and collaborative intelligence â€” demands a new class of infrastructure. Existing serving systems, designed for the chatbot era, no longer satisfy the growing needs of this shifting landscape **Vajra** is a low-latency distributed LLM inference serving engine built for serving these second-wave applications.

## Quick Start

```python
from vajra import InferenceEngine, SamplingParams
from vajra.config import InferenceEngineConfig, ModelConfig

# Configure the engine
model_config = ModelConfig(model="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf")
engine_config = InferenceEngineConfig(model_config=model_config)

# Create engine and generate
engine = InferenceEngine(engine_config)
sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.7, max_tokens=100)

engine.add_request("req1", "Tell me about quantum computing", sampling_params)

for output in engine.get_outputs():
    if output.finished:
        print(f"Generated: {output.outputs[0].text}")
```
