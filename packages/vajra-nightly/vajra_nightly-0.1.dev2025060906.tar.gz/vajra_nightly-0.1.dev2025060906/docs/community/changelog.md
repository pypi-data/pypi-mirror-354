## Version Numbering Convention

Vajra follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** version for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version for backward-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** version for backward-compatible bug fixes

During the 0.x.y development phase, minor version increments may include breaking changes as the API stabilizes.
