# MarkdownDeck Usage Guide

Welcome to MarkdownDeck! This guide explains how to use our special flavor of Markdown to create beautiful and complex Google Slides presentations with ease.

## Core Concepts

### Slides

Slides are the fundamental building blocks of your presentation. You separate one slide from the next using a triple equals sign (`===`) on its own line.

```markdown
# This is Slide 1

# Content for the first slide.

# This is Slide 2

Content for the second slide.
```

### Title, Subtitle, and Footer

- **Title**: The first H1 heading (`#`) on a slide is treated as its title.
- **Subtitle**: An H2 heading (`##`) immediately following the title is treated as the slide's subtitle.
- **Footer**: Content placed after a triple at-sign (`@@@`) separator at the end of a slide becomes the slide's footer.

```markdown
# My Awesome Presentation

## A deep dive into cool things

This is the main content.

@@@
Â© 2024 My Company | Confidential
```

### Speaker Notes

You can add speaker notes anywhere on a slide using an HTML comment.

```markdown
<!-- notes: Remember to mention the Q3 results here. -->
```

### Sections: The Building Blocks of Layout

Within a single slide, you can structure your content into sections. Sections are the primary way to control layout.

- **Vertical Sections**: Use a triple dash (`---`) to split content into vertical sections that stack on top of each other.
- **Horizontal Sections (Columns)**: Use a triple asterisk (`***`) to split content within a vertical section into horizontal columns.

```markdown
## Two Vertical Sections

## Top content area.

Bottom content area.

===

## Three Horizontal Columns

[width=1/3]
Left Column

---

[width=1/3]
Middle Column

---

[width=1/3]
Right Column
```

## Directives: The Core of Control

Directives are the most powerful feature of MarkdownDeck. They allow you to control the layout, spacing, and styling of your content. A directive is a key-value pair enclosed in square brackets: `[key=value]`.

### Directive Scoping: Where do they apply?

Understanding where a directive applies is key. MarkdownDeck has three simple, hierarchical rules:

#### 1. Element-Scoped Directives (Same-Line)

A directive placed on the **same line** as an element applies **only to that element**. This is the most specific way to target something.

````markdown
# My Title [color=blue]

![An image](url.png) [border=2pt solid red]```

#### 2. Section-Scoped Directives (Own-Line)

A directive placed on its **own line** applies to the **smallest section that contains it**.

```markdown
### This whole section is centered

[align=center]
This text is centered.
And this text is also centered.

---

### This section is not

This text is left-aligned by default.
```
````

This is powerful for layouts. To style a specific column, place the directive inside it:

```markdown
Left Column

---

[background=#f0f0f0]
This column has a gray background.
```

#### 3. List Item-Scoped Directives

A directive on its **own line immediately before a list item** applies **only to that list item** and any of its nested children.

```markdown
- First item (default style).
  [color=red]
- Second item (this will be red).
  - Nested item (also red).
- Third item (default style).
```
