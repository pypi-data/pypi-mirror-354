# CALT: Computer ALgebra with Transformer
This project is currently in its initial development phase. The file structure and content are subject to significant changes. Please ensure you are referring to the latest version when using it.


### Weights & Biases (wandb) Setup

If you are using Weights & Biases (wandb) for the first time to log training progress, you will need to create an account on their website and set up your API key. When you run the training script for the first time, you will be prompted to enter your API key.
