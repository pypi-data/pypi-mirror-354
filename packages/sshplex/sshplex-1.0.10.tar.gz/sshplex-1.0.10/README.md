**Multiplex your SSH connections with style**

SSHplex is a Python-based SSH connection multiplexer that provides a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) for selecting and connecting to multiple hosts simultaneously using tmux. Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, SSHplex integrates with NetBox as a Source of Truth and creates organized tmux sessions for efficient multi-host management.

## ⚠️ Development Status

**SSHplex is currently in early development phase.** While the core functionality is working, this project is actively being developed and may have breaking changes between versions. Use at your own discretion in production environments.

## 📦 Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install sshplex
```

This installs SSHplex with all its dependencies and makes the `sshplex` and `sshplex-cli` commands available system-wide.

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sshplex.git
cd sshplex
pip install -e .
```

### Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sshplex.git
cd sshplex
./scripts/setup-dev.sh
```

## �📋 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **tmux** (for terminal multiplexing)
- **NetBox** instance with API access
- **SSH key** configured for target hosts
- **macOS or Linux** (Windows support via WSL)

### System Dependencies

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install tmux python3

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update && sudo apt install tmux python3 python3-pip

# RHEL/CentOS/Fedora
sudo dnf install tmux python3 python3-pip
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Full TUI Interface (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone repository for full functionality
git clone https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex.git
cd sshplex

# Install in development mode
pip3 install -e .

# Run main TUI application
python3 sshplex.py
```

### Option 2: CLI Debug Interface (Pip Install)
```bash
# Install from PyPI (once published)
pip install sshplex

# Use CLI debug interface
sshplex-cli              # NetBox connectivity test
sshplex-cli --help       # Show help
```

## 🚀 Installation

### From PyPI (CLI Debug Interface)

```bash
pip install sshplex
```

This installs the `sshplex-cli` command for NetBox connectivity testing and configuration validation.

### From Source (Full TUI Application)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sabrimjd/sshplex.git
cd sshplex
pip install -e .
```

This gives you access to the full TUI interface with tmux integration.

## 📖 Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Start SSHplex**: Run `python3 sshplex.py`
2. **Select Hosts**: Use the TUI to browse and select hosts from NetBox
3. **Configure Session**: Choose between panes or windows, enable/disable broadcasting
4. **Connect**: SSHplex creates a tmux session and establishes SSH connections
5. **Work**: Use tmux commands to navigate between hosts
6. **Detach/Reattach**: Use `Ctrl+b d` to detach, `tmux attach` to reattach

### tmux Commands (once attached)

```bash
# Navigation
Ctrl+b + Arrow Keys    # Switch between panes
Ctrl+b + n/p          # Next/Previous window
Ctrl+b + 0-9          # Switch to window by number

# Session management
Ctrl+b + d            # Detach from session
tmux list-sessions    # List all tmux sessions
tmux attach -t <name> # Attach to specific session

# Pane management
Ctrl+b + x            # Close current pane
Ctrl+b + z            # Zoom/unzoom current pane
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### NetBox Filters

Customize which hosts are retrieved from NetBox:

```yaml
netbox:
  default_filters:
    status: "active"           # Only active hosts
    role: "virtual-machine"    # Only VMs
    platform: "linux"         # Only Linux hosts
    cluster: "production"      # Specific cluster
    has_primary_ip: "true"     # Only hosts with IP addresses
```

### tmux Layouts

Choose how SSH connections are arranged:

- `tiled`: Automatic tiling layout (default)
- `even-horizontal`: Horizontal split
- `even-vertical`: Vertical split

### Logging Control

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: false  # Disable logging completely
  level: "ERROR"  # Only show errors
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **NetBox Connection Failed**
   - Verify URL and API token
   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure SSL settings match your NetBox instance

2. **SSH Key Authentication Failed**
   - Verify SSH key path in configuration
   - Ensure key has proper permissions (`chmod 600`)
   - Test manual SSH connection to target hosts

3. **tmux Session Not Created**
   - Ensure tmux is installed and in PATH
   - Check SSH connectivity to at least one host
   - Verify tmux is not already running a session with the same name

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: true
  level: "DEBUG"
  file: "logs/sshplex.log"
```
