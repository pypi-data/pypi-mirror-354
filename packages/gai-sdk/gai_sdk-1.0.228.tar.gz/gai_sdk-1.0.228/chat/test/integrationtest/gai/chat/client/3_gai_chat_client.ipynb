      "Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two great mountains, there lived a humble cobbler named Thomas. Every day, he would wake up at the crack of dawn and begin his long journey to the top of the eastern mountain, where he would collect the finest threads and fabrics for his intricate and beautiful shoes. The villagers would often remark on how Thomas's shoes seemed to dance with every step, and many a young man sought to marry the girl who wore the prettiest pair. One day, an elegant stranger passed through the village, seeking the finest cobbler in all the land. Intrigued by tales of Thomas's remarkable footwear, the stranger set out to discover the secret behind his craft. Upon reaching the mountain, the stranger found Thomas patiently waiting at the summit, surrounded by a magnificent array of fabrics and threads. As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the scene, Thomas revealed his secret: the true magic of his shoes lay not in the materials themselves, but in the countless hours of love and care he poured into each pair. The stranger, inspired by this revelation, decided to embark on a new journey, spreading the tale of Thomas's extraordinary talent and inspiring generations to come.{'type': 'finish_reason', 'finish_reason': 'stop'}"
