## TL;DR
`TorchFSM` is a PyTorch-based library for solving PDEs using Fourier spectral method. It is designed for physics-based deep learning and differentiable simulations.

## Feature

* **Modular by design**: TorchFSM offers a modular architecture with essential mathematical operatorsâ€”like divergence, gradient, and convectionâ€”so you can build custom solvers like stacking building blocks, quickly and intuitively.

* **GPU-accelerated**: TorchFSM leverages GPU computing to speed up simulations dramatically. Run complex 3D PDEs in minutes, not hours, with seamless hardware acceleration.

* **Batched simulation support**: Built on PyTorch, TorchFSM enables batched simulations with varied initial conditionsâ€”ideal for parameter sweeps, uncertainty quantification, or ensemble analysis.

* **Differentiable and ML-ready**: Fully differentiable by design, TorchFSM integrates naturally with machine learning workflowsâ€”for residual operators, differentiable physics, or dataset generation.
