## About

The GenLayer Testing Suite is a powerful testing framework designed to streamline the development and validation of intelligent contracts within the GenLayer ecosystem. Built on top of [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) and [genlayer-py](https://docs.genlayer.com/api-references/genlayer-py), this suite provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools for deploying, interacting with, and testing intelligent contracts efficiently in a simulated GenLayer environment.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install genlayer-test
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from gltest import get_contract_factory, default_account, create_account
from gltest.assertions import tx_execution_succeeded

factory = get_contract_factory("MyContract")
# Deploy a contract with default account
contract = factory.deploy() # This will be deployed with default_account
assert contract.account == default_account

# Deploy a contract with other account
other_account = create_account()
contract = factory.deploy(account=other_account)
assert contract.account == other_account

# Interact with the contract
result = contract.get_value()  # Read method
tx_receipt = contract.set_value(args=["new_value"])  # Write method

assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx_receipt)
```

## 📚 Examples

### Project Structure

Before diving into the examples, let's understand the basic project structure:

```
genlayer-example/
├── contracts/              # Contract definitions
│   └── storage.py          # Example storage contract
└── test/                   # Test files
    └── test_contract.py    # Contract test cases
```

### Storage Contract Example

Let's examine a simple Storage contract that demonstrates basic read and write operations:

```python
# { "Depends": "py-genlayer:test" }

from genlayer import *


# contract class
class Storage(gl.Contract):
    # State variable to store data
    storage: str

    # Constructor - initializes the contract state
    def __init__(self, initial_storage: str):
        self.storage = initial_storage

    # Read method - marked with @gl.public.view decorator
    # Returns the current storage value
    @gl.public.view
    def get_storage(self) -> str:
        return self.storage

    # Write method - marked with @gl.public.write decorator
    # Updates the storage value
    @gl.public.write
    def update_storage(self, new_storage: str) -> None:
        self.storage = new_storage
```

Key features demonstrated in this contract:
- State variable declaration
- Constructor with initialization
- Read-only method with `@gl.public.view` decorator
- State-modifying method with `@gl.public.write` decorator
- Type hints for better code clarity

### Contract Deployment

Here's how to deploy the Storage contract:

```python
from gltest import get_contract_factory, default_account

def test_deployment():
    # Get the contract factory for your contract
    # it will search in the contracts directory
    factory = get_contract_factory("Storage")
    
    # Deploy the contract with constructor arguments
    contract = factory.deploy(
        args=["initial_value"],  # Constructor arguments
        account=default_account,  # Account to deploy from
        consensus_max_rotations=3,  # Optional: max consensus rotations
        leader_only=False,  # Optional: whether to run only on leader
    )
    
    # Contract is now deployed and ready to use
    assert contract.address is not None
```

### Read Methods

Reading from the contract is straightforward:

```python
from gltest import get_contract_factory, default_account

def test_read_methods():
    # Get the contract factory and deploy the contract
    factory = get_contract_factory("Storage")
    contract = factory.deploy(account=default_account)
    
    # Call a read-only method
    result = contract.get_value(args=[])
    
    # Assert the result matches the initial value
    assert result == "initial_value"
```

### Write Methods

Writing to the contract requires transaction handling:

```python
from gltest import get_contract_factory
from gltest.assertions import tx_execution_succeeded

def test_write_methods():
    # Get the contract factory and deploy the contract
    factory = get_contract_factory("Storage")
    contract = factory.deploy()
    
    # Call a write method with arguments
    tx_receipt = contract.update_storage(
        args=["new_value"],  # Method arguments
        value=0,  # Optional: amount of native currency to send
        consensus_max_rotations=3,  # Optional: max consensus rotations
        leader_only=False,  # Optional: whether to run only on leader
        wait_interval=1,  # Optional: seconds between status checks
        wait_retries=10,  # Optional: max number of retries
    )
    
    # Verify the transaction was successful
    assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx_receipt)
    
    # Verify the value was updated
    assert contract.get_storage() == "new_value"
```

### Assertions

The GenLayer Testing Suite provides powerful assertion functions to validate transaction results and their output:

#### Basic Transaction Assertions

```python
from gltest.assertions import tx_execution_succeeded, tx_execution_failed

# Basic success/failure checks
assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx_receipt)
assert tx_execution_failed(tx_receipt)  # Opposite of tx_execution_succeeded
```

#### Advanced Output Matching

You can match specific patterns in the transaction's stdout and stderr output using regex patterns, similar to pytest's `match` parameter:

```python
# Simple string matching
assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx_receipt, match_std_out="Process completed")
assert tx_execution_failed(tx_receipt, match_std_err="Warning: deprecated")

# Regex pattern matching
assert tx_execution_succeeded(tx_receipt, match_std_out=r".*code \d+")
assert tx_execution_failed(tx_receipt, match_std_err=r"Method.*failed")
```

#### Assertion Function Parameters

Both `tx_execution_succeeded` and `tx_execution_failed` accept the following parameters:

- `result`: The transaction result object from contract method calls
- `match_std_out` (optional): String or regex pattern to match in stdout
- `match_std_err` (optional): String or regex pattern to match in stderr

**Network Compatibility**: The stdout/stderr matching feature (`match_std_out` and `match_std_err` parameters) is only available when running on **studionet** and **localnet**. These features are not supported on testnet.

For more example contracts, check out the [contracts directory](tests/examples/contracts) which contains various sample contracts demonstrating different features and use cases.

## 📝 Best Practices

1. **Test Organization**
   - Keep tests in a dedicated `tests` directory
   - Use descriptive test names
   - Group related tests using pytest markers

2. **Contract Deployment**
   - Always verify deployment success
   - Use appropriate consensus parameters
   - Handle deployment errors gracefully

3. **Transaction Handling**
   - Always wait for transaction finalization
   - Verify transaction status
   - Handle transaction failures appropriately

4. **State Management**
   - Reset state between tests
   - Use fixtures for common setup
   - Avoid test dependencies

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Failures**
   - **Problem**: Contract deployment fails due to various reasons like insufficient funds, invalid contract code, or network issues.
   - **Solution**: Implement proper error handling
   ```python
   try:
       contract = factory.deploy(args=["initial_value"])
   except DeploymentError as e:
       print(f"Deployment failed: {e}")
   ```

2. **Transaction Timeouts**
   - **Problem**: Transactions take too long to complete or fail due to network congestion or consensus delays.
   - **Solution**: Adjust timeout parameters and implement retry logic:
   ```python
   tx_receipt = contract.set_value(
       args=["new_value"],
       wait_interval=2,  # Increase wait interval between status checks
       wait_retries=20,  # Increase number of retry attempts
   )
   ```

3. **Consensus Issues**
   - **Problem**: Transactions fail due to consensus-related problems like network partitions or slow consensus.
   - **Solution**: Adjust consensus parameters and try different modes:
   ```python
   # Try with increased consensus parameters
   contract = factory.deploy(
       consensus_max_rotations=5,  # Increase number of consensus rotations
       leader_only=True,  # Try leader-only mode for faster execution
   )
   
   # For critical operations, use more conservative settings
   contract = factory.deploy(
       consensus_max_rotations=10,  # More rotations for better reliability
       leader_only=False,  # Full consensus for better security
       wait_interval=3,  # Longer wait between checks
       wait_retries=30  # More retries for consensus
   )
   ```

4. **Contracts Directory Issues**
   - **Problem**: `get_contract_factory` can't find your contract files.
   - **Solution**: Ensure proper directory structure and configuration:
   ```bash
   # Default structure
   your_project/
   ├── contracts/           # Default contracts directory
   │   └── my_contract.py   # Your contract file
   └── tests/
       └── test_contract.py # Your test file
   
   # If using a different directory structure
   gltest --contracts-dir /path/to/your/contracts
   ```

5. **Contract File Naming and Structure**
   - **Problem**: Contracts aren't being recognized or loaded properly.
   - **Solution**: Follow the correct naming and structure conventions:
   ```python
   # Correct file: contracts/my_contract.py

   # Correct structure:
   from genlayer import *
   
   class MyContract(gl.Contract):
       # Contract code here
       pass
   

   # Incorrect structure:
   class MyContract:  # Missing gl.Contract inheritance
       pass
   ```

6. **Environment Setup Issues**
   - **Problem**: Tests fail due to missing or incorrect environment setup.
   - **Solution**: Verify your environment:
   ```bash
   # Check Python version
   python --version  # Should be >= 3.12
   
   # Check GenLayer Studio status
   docker ps  # Should show GenLayer Studio running
   
   # Verify package installation
   pip list | grep genlayer-test  # Should show installed version
   ```
