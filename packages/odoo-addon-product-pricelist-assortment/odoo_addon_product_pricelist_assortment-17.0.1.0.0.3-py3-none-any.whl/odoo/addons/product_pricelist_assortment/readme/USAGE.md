Configuration & Usage

1. Activate pricelists in Sales > Configuration > Settings:
  - Enable Pricelists and select Advanced price rules (discounts, formulas).
2. Create or edit a Product Assortment .
3. Create or edit a Sales Pricelist under Sales > Products > Pricelists.
4. Navigate to the Assortment Items tab.
5. Add one or more lines. For each line:
  - Select the Assortment that will apply.
  - Define the pricing formula and other conditions as you would in a standard pricelist item.
6. Once your assortment-based rules are configured, click the Launch Assortment Update button:
  - This action will generate standard pricelist.item entries for each product included in the selected assortments.
  - These generated rules are what actually apply pricing changes to sales documents.

This setup allows you to manage complex, reusable pricing rules in bulk, improving both flexibility and efficiency.

A scheduled action (Pricelist Assortment - Launch update) ensures the pricelist items stay up to date when assortments are modified.

This scheduled action can be enabled/disabled and configured to automate the update of these assortment-based pricing rules.
