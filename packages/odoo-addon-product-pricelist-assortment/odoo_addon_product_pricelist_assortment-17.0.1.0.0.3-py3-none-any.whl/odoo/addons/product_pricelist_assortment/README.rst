Usage
=====

Configuration & Usage

1. Activate pricelists in Sales > Configuration > Settings:

- Enable Pricelists and select Advanced price rules (discounts,
  formulas).

2. Create or edit a Product Assortment .
3. Create or edit a Sales Pricelist under Sales > Products > Pricelists.
4. Navigate to the Assortment Items tab.
5. Add one or more lines. For each line:

- Select the Assortment that will apply.
- Define the pricing formula and other conditions as you would in a
  standard pricelist item.

6. Once your assortment-based rules are configured, click the Launch
   Assortment Update button:

- This action will generate standard pricelist.item entries for each
  product included in the selected assortments.
- These generated rules are what actually apply pricing changes to sales
  documents.

This setup allows you to manage complex, reusable pricing rules in bulk,
improving both flexibility and efficiency.

A scheduled action (Pricelist Assortment - Launch update) ensures the
pricelist items stay up to date when assortments are modified.

This scheduled action can be enabled/disabled and configured to automate
the update of these assortment-based pricing rules.
