# pystray-freedesktop

This is a fork of the [pystray](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pystray) library with enhanced freedesktop.org support for Linux systems.

## What's different in this fork?

This fork includes patches that improve compatibility with Linux desktop environments that follow freedesktop.org standards, particularly enhancing system tray icon functionality in modern Linux desktop environments.

## Why this fork?

While working on [GTK LLM Chat](https://gtk-llm-chat.fuentelibre.org/), we needed better Linux system tray support. The patches in this fork provide:

- Enhanced freedesktop.org compatibility
- Better integration with modern Linux desktop environments
- Improved system tray icon handling

## Installation

```bash
pip install pystray-freedesktop
```

## Usage

This fork maintains full API compatibility with the original pystray library:

```python
import pystray
from pystray import MenuItem as item
from PIL import Image

# Your existing pystray code works unchanged
def quit_action(icon):
    icon.stop()

image = Image.open("icon.png")
menu = pystray.Menu(item('Quit', quit_action))
icon = pystray.Icon("test", image, menu=menu)
icon.run()
```

## Contributing

This is a temporary fork maintained for the GTK LLM Chat project. We aim to contribute these improvements back to the upstream pystray project.
