Intermediate representation (IR) for many-body propagators
==========================================================

This library provides routines for constructing and working with the
intermediate representation of correlation functions.  It provides:

 - on-the-fly computation of basis functions for arbitrary cutoff Î›
 - basis functions and singular values are accurate to full precision
 - routines for sparse sampling
