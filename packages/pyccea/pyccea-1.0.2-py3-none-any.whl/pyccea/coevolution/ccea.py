    Attributes
    ----------
    subpop_sizes: list
        Subpopulation sizes, that is, the number of individuals in each subpopulation.
    decomposer: object of one of the decomposition classes
        Responsible for decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.
    collaborator: object of one of the collaboration classes.
        Responsible for selecting collaborators for individuals.
    fitness_function: object of one of the fitness classes.
        Responsible for evaluating individuals, that is, subsets of features.
    initializer: object of one of the subpopulation initializers
        Responsible for initializing all individuals of all subpopulations.
    optimizers: list of objects of optimizer classes
        Responsible for evolving each of the subpopulations individually.
    subpops: list
        Individuals from all subpopulations. Each individual is represented by a binary
        n-dimensional array, where n is the number of features. If there is a 1 in the i-th
        position of the array, it indicates that the i-th feature should be considered and if
        there is a 0, it indicates that the feature should not be considered.
    fitness: list
        Evaluation of all context vectors from all subpopulations.
    context_vectors: list
        Complete problem solutions.
    convergence_curve: list
        Best global fitness in each generation.
    current_best: dict
        Current best individual of each subpopulation and its respective evaluation.
    best_context_vector: np.ndarray
        Best solution of the complete problem.
    best_fitness: float
        Evaluation of the best solution of the complete problem.
    feature_idxs : np.ndarray
        List of feature indexes.
