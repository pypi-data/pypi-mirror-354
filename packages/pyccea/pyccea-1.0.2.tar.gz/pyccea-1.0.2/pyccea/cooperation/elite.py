        In the scenario of n subpopulations, the elite collaboration method involves choosing n
        collaborators, with one selected from each subpopulation. Notably, the individual
        becomes their own collaborator within their specific subpopulation, while the remaining
        collaborators are chosen from the top k individuals in each respective subpopulation.

        ----------
        subpop_idx : int
            Index of the subpopulation to which the individual belongs.
        indiv_idx : int
            Index of the individual in its respective subpopulation. The vector that represents
            the individual is obtained from the `current_subpops`, where the individuals were
            evolved and not evaluated.
        previous_subpops : list

        current_subpops : list

        fitness : list
