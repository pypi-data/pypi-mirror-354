class BaseOperation(ABC):
    """
    Abstract Base Class for defining operations with potential backend-specific implementations.

    This class provides a structure for defining a core operation (`forward_native`)
    and allowing optional, optimized implementations for different hardware backends
    supported by JAX (TPU, GPU - CUDA/ROCm, CPU).

    The `__call__` method acts as a dispatcher, detecting the current JAX default
    backend and executing the corresponding `forward_...` method. If a specific
    backend implementation (e.g., `forward_tpu`) is not overridden in a subclass,
    it defaults to calling `forward_native`.

    Subclasses MUST implement the `forward_native` method. They CAN optionally
    override `forward_tpu`, `forward_gpu`, `forward_cpu`, `forward_rocm`, or
    `forward_cuda` to provide backend-specific optimizations.

        is available or applicable.
