class RewardConfig(TrainingArguments):
    r"""
    Configuration class for the [`RewardTrainer`].

    Parameters:
        model_name (str): The name of the model. Defaults to "RewardTrainer".
        max_length (int, optional): Maximum length of the sequences (prompt + completion) in the batch,
            filters out entries that exceed the limit.  Defaults to 1024.
        disable_dropout (bool, optional): Whether to disable dropout in the model. Defaults to True.
        dataset_num_proc (int, optional): Number of processes to use for processing the dataset. Defaults to None.
        center_rewards_coefficient (float, optional): Coefficient to incentivize the reward model to output
            mean-zero rewards. Defaults to 0.1.
        remove_unused_columns (bool, optional): Whether to remove the columns that are not used by the model's
            forward pass. Can be `True` only if the dataset is pretokenized. Defaults to False.
