This module extends the functionality of event tracks to allow users to
set some track locations as non-overlappable. Thus, an error will happen
if somebody tries to save more than one track at the same time and
location.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Events > Configuration > Locations*.
2. By default, no location is overlappable, but here you can enable
   overlapping for some of them if you want.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to *Events > Events*.
2. Enter some event with tracks.
3. Create some tracks for it.
4. If more than one confirmed track overlaps with other in the same
   location, and the location is not overlappable, you will not be able
   to save it.
