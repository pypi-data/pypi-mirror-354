can you add a green bar ontop of  the photo that was selected  and a red on the other on half a second. during that time should be able to cancel the deletion via a button or by pressing escape?

can you add the folder at the top in the style of an adress bar?

If both phos are landscape please show them in an up/down split and seelect them with up/down.
