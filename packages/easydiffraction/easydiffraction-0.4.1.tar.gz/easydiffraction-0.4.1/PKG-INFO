**EasyDiffraction** is a Python library for calculating powder diffraction
patterns based on structural models and refining their parameters against
experimental data.

This library serves as the foundation of the [EasyDiffraction Application], a
user-friendly graphical interface that streamlines and accelerates the analysis
of diffraction experiments.

**EasyDiffraction** is built upon the [EasyScience] framework, which provides
essential tools for developing scientific libraries and applications.
