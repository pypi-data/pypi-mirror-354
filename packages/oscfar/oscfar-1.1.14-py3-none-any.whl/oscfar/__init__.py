    """
    Performs OS-CFAR detection on 2D data (spectrogram), typically summed along
    the frequency axis to get a time series, and applies various filtering steps.

    Args:
        data (np.ndarray): 2D array of input data (e.g., spectrogram, frequency x time).
                           Assumed to be in linear power.
        guard_cells (int): Number of guard cells on EACH side of the CUT for OS-CFAR.
        train_cells (int): Number of training cells on EACH side of the CUT for OS-CFAR.
        rank_k (float): The rank (as a fraction of total training cells) for OS-CFAR.
                        E.g., 0.75 for the 75th percentile.
        threshold_factor (float): The scaling factor (alpha) for the OS-CFAR threshold.
        averaging (int): Window size for the initial smoothing filter (mean or median).
        min_dist (int): Minimum distance (in samples) between final detected peaks.
        min_snr (float): Minimum local SNR required for a peak to be kept.
        baseline (float): Secondary threshold factor applied to the mean time series
                          to remove peaks too close to the baseline.
        smoothing (str, optional): Type of initial smoothing to apply to the summed
                                   time series ('mean', 'median', 'lowess', or None).
                                   Defaults to 'mean'.
        lowess_frac (float, optional): Fraction of data used for LOWESS smoothing
                                       if smoothing='lowess'. Defaults to 0.01.
        clustering (int or bool, optional): If an integer > 0, applies DBSCAN clustering
                                            to the final peaks using this integer as
                                            the 'min_samples' parameter. If False or 0,
                                            no clustering is applied. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        Peaks: A Peaks object containing the final detected peak indices and the
               original OS-CFAR threshold array.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If input data is not a 2D NumPy array.
