        I need to create a new project with this description: "{prompt}"
        
        Please provide a comprehensive analysis and detailed project plan. Include:
        
        1. Project type and main technologies (language, framework, libraries)
        2. Project architecture and design patterns to use
        3. Required file structure with explanation of each component
        4. Key files that need to be created with their purpose
        5. Dependencies that would need to be installed
        6. Development environment recommendations
        7. Any best practices specific to this type of project
        8. For any framework, specify the official scaffolding command that would initialize the project
        
        Format the response as:
        
        PROJECT_TYPE: [project type]
        
        MAIN_TECHNOLOGIES: [comma-separated list of main technologies]
        
        ARCHITECTURE: [Brief description of recommended architecture]
        
        SCAFFOLD_COMMAND: [Official scaffolding command if applicable, or NONE if not applicable]
        
        SCAFFOLD_TYPE: [One of: CREATES_OWN_DIR, NEEDS_EMPTY_DIR, IN_PLACE, or NONE. Indicates how the scaffolding tool behaves]
        
        PROJECT_PLAN:
        [Detailed explanation of the project structure and components]
        
        DEPENDENCIES:
        [List of key dependencies with versions if applicable]
        
        FILE_STRUCTURE:
        [Tree structure of directories and files to be created]
        
        DEVELOPMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS:
        [Recommendations for development environment and workflows]
        
        For SCAFFOLD_COMMAND, provide the exact command that should be run to initialize the project with the official tooling.
        Examples:
        - For React: npx create-react-app my-app
        - For Vue: npm init vue@latest my-app
        - For Angular: ng new my-app
        - For Next.js: npx create-next-app my-app
        - For Express: npx express-generator my-app
        - For Django: django-admin startproject myproject
        - For Spring Boot: spring init --dependencies=web,data-jpa my-project
        - For Flutter: flutter create my_app
        - For Rails: rails new my_app
        - For .NET Core: dotnet new webapp -o MyApp
        - For Gatsby: npx gatsby new my-site
        - For Svelte: npm create svelte@latest my-app
        - For Electron: npx create-electron-app my-app
        - For NestJS: nest new my-nest-app
        - For Laravel: composer create-project laravel/laravel my-app
        
        For SCAFFOLD_TYPE, specify how the scaffold command behaves:
        - CREATES_OWN_DIR: The command creates its own directory (like create-react-app my-app)
        - NEEDS_EMPTY_DIR: The command needs to be run inside an empty directory
        - IN_PLACE: The command adds files to the current directory structure
        - NONE: No scaffolding command is needed or available
