  2024-06-17T17:23:55Z ERROR  LAMBDA_WARNING: Unhandled exception. The most likely cause is an
       issue in the function code. However, in rare cases, a Lambda runtime update can cause
       unexpected function behavior. For functions using managed runtimes, runtime updates can be
       triggered by a function change, or can be applied automatically. To determine if the runtime
       has been updated, check the runtime version in the INIT_START log entry. If this error
       correlates with a change in the runtime version, you may be able to mitigate this error by
       temporarily rolling back to the previous runtime version. For more information, see
       https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/runtimes-update.html
