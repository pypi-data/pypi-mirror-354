"""
JaxABM: An agent-based modeling framework accelerated by JAX.

This package provides tools for building, running, and analyzing agent-based models
with an easy-to-use AgentPy-like interface while maintaining the performance benefits
of JAX acceleration.

The framework now provides primarily an AgentPy-like interface:
- Agent: Base class for creating agents
- AgentList: Container for managing collections of agents
- Environment: Container for environment state and spatial structures
- Grid: Grid environment for spatial models
- Network: Network environment for network models
- Model: Base class for creating models
- Results: Container for simulation results

The core JAX components are still available:
- AgentType: Protocol for defining agent behaviors
- AgentCollection: Collection of agents of the same type
- ModelConfig: Configuration for model execution
- JaxModel: Core model implementation with JAX acceleration

The legacy version (non-JAX) is available directly from the package root.
The JAX-accelerated version is available when JAX is installed.
