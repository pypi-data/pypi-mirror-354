class normal_division_tracker:
    """
    A class that tracks cell divisions in a video sequence. The tracker uses the Intersection over Area (IoA) metric to track cells and identify daughter cells.

    Attributes:
    - IoA_thresh_daughter (float): The IoA threshold for identifying daughter cells.
    - min_daughter (int): The minimum number of daughter cells.
    - max_daughter (int): The maximum number of daughter cells.
    - IoA_thresh (float): The IoA threshold for tracking cells, which is used to instantly track a cell before looking for daughters.
    - IoA_thresh_aggressive (float): The aggressive IoA threshold for tracking cells.
    - segm_video (ndarray): The segmented video sequence.
    - tracked_video (ndarray): The tracked video sequence.
    - assignments (dict): A dictionary mapping untracked cell IDs to tracked cell IDs. (Only NEW cells are in this dictionary, so things the tracker could not assign to a cell in the previous frame and was given a new unique ID.)
    - IDs_prev (list): A list mapping index from IoA matrix to IDs. (Index in list = Index in IoA matrix)
    - rp (list): The region properties of the current frame.
    - mother_daughters (list): A list of tuples, where each tuple contains the index of a mother cell and a list of indices of its daughter cells. (INDICIES ARE BASED ON THE INPUT IoA MATRIX and not the IDs in the video.)
    - IDs_curr_untracked (list): A list of current cell IDs that are untracked. (INDICIES ARE BASED ON THE INPUT IoA MATRIX and not the IDs in the video.)
    - tracked_IDs (set): A set of all cell IDs in current frame after tracking.
    - tracked_lab (ndarray): The tracked current frame.

    Methods:
    - __init__(self, segm_video, IoA_thresh_daughter, min_daughter, max_daughter, IoA_thresh, IoA_thresh_aggressive): Initializes the normal_division_tracker object. Mainly sets the parameters. And introduces the tracked_videos dummy and the first frame.
