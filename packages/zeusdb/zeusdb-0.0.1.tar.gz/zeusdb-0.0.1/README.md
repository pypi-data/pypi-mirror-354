## âœ¨ What is ZeusDB?

ZeusDB is a next-generation, high-performance data platform designed for modern analytics, machine learning, and real-time insights. Born out of the need for scalable, intelligent data infrastructure, ZeusDB fuses the power of traditional databases with the flexibility and performance of modern data architectures. It is built for data teams, engineers, and analysts who need low-latency access to complex analytical workflows, without sacrificing ease of use or developer control.

ZeusDB serves as the backbone for demanding applications, offering advanced features such as:

  - Vector and structured data support to power hybrid search, recommendation engines, and LLM integrations.

  - Real-time analytics with low-latency querying, ideal for dashboards and ML model serving.

  - Extensibility and safety through modern languages like Rust and Python, enabling custom logic and high-performance pipelines.

  - DevOps-ready deployment across cloud or on-prem, with version-controlled configuration, observability hooks, and minimal operational overhead.

Whether you are building a GenAI backend, managing large-scale time-series data, or architecting a unified analytics layer, ZeusDB gives you the foundation to move fast and with incredible scale.
