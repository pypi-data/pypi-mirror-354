## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Streaming complexity**: Start with OpenAI (simplest), iterate
2. **MCP spec ambiguity**: Reference Anthropic docs, ask community
3. **Performance regression**: Benchmark after each feature
4. **Test coverage drop**: Write tests alongside code
5. **Documentation lag**: Update docs same day as implementation

### Contingency Plans
- If behind schedule: Prioritize streaming + MCP (most requested)
- If tests fail: Fix before moving to next feature
- If performance issues: Profile and optimize before continuing
- If design questions: Stick to simplicity principle
