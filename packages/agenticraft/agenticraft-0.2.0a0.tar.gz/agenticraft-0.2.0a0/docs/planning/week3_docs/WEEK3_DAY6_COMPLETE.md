  - Relationship inference from text
  - Graph traversal and path finding
  - Multiple visualization formats (dict, cytoscape, graphviz)
  - Capacity management with LRU eviction
  - Query capabilities with filters

### Afternoon (3 hours) - Marketplace Foundation

#### 3. **Plugin Manifest Schema**

  - Dependency specifications
  - Configuration options
  - API endpoint definitions
  - Examples and documentation
  - YAML serialization/deserialization

#### 4. **Registry Client**

  - Version comparison and ordering
  - Version range specifications (^, ~, >=, etc.)
  - Compatibility checking
  - Conflict detection
