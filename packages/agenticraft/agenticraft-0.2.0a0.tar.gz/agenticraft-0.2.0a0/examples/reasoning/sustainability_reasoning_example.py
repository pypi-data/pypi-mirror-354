"""Simple Reasoning Transparency Example - Sustainability Use Case

This beginner-friendly example demonstrates AgentiCraft's reasoning transparency
feature through a practical sustainability advisor scenario. It shows how agents
expose their thought process while solving real-world problems.

For a more comprehensive reasoning transparency guide with multiple patterns,
see reasoning_transparency.py in this directory.

- Goal: Reduce consumption and calculate 30% savings

Step 2: Searching for energy reduction strategies
- Searching knowledge base for "green building" practices
- Found: LEED certification, passive house design, smart systems

Step 3: Searching for renewable energy options
- Searching for "renewable energy" solutions
- Found: Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal options

Step 4: Calculating potential savings
- Using calculator tool with current_usage=50000, reduction_percent=30
- Results: 15,000 kWh saved, $1,800/year cost savings

Step 5: Formulating comprehensive response
- Prioritizing most effective solutions for office buildings
- Including both immediate and long-term strategies
- Providing specific calculated savings"""

**Energy Reduction Strategies:**

1. **Immediate Actions** (10-15% reduction):
   - LED lighting upgrade throughout
   - Smart thermostats and occupancy sensors
   - Weather stripping and insulation improvements

2. **Medium-term Improvements** (15-20% reduction):
   - Energy-efficient HVAC system upgrade
   - Smart building management system
   - Window films or double-glazing

3. **Long-term Investments** (20-30%+ reduction):
   - Solar panel installation
   - Green roof or cool roof technology
   - Full building envelope upgrade

**30% Reduction Calculation:**
- Current usage: 50,000 kWh/year
- 30% reduction: 15,000 kWh saved
- New usage: 35,000 kWh/year
- **Annual cost savings: $1,800** (at $0.12/kWh)

Your building currently uses 25 kWh/sq ft/year, which is above average for offices 
(typical is 15-20). This means you have excellent potential for savings. I recommend 
starting with an energy audit to identify the biggest opportunities specific to 
your building."""
