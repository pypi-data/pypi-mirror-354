## üéØ Reasoning Patterns Overview

### Chain of Thought (CoT)
**Best for**: Problems with clear sequential steps
- ‚úì Mathematical calculations
- ‚úì Logical deductions
- ‚úì Process analysis
- ‚úì Step-by-step explanations

**How it works**: Breaks down complex problems into sequential steps, building confidence through each stage.

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT)
**Best for**: Problems with multiple valid approaches
- ‚úì Creative design
- ‚úì Strategic planning
- ‚úì Optimization problems
- ‚úì Exploring alternatives

**How it works**: Explores multiple solution paths simultaneously, evaluating and pruning to find the optimal approach.

### ReAct
**Best for**: Problems requiring external information or iteration
- ‚úì Research tasks
- ‚úì Troubleshooting
- ‚úì Data gathering
- ‚úì Validation and testing

**How it works**: Alternates between thinking and acting, using tools to gather information and refine solutions.

## üîß Setup Options

### Option 1: No Setup Required (Mock Mode)
All examples work without API keys! They use simulated responses to demonstrate the patterns.

```bash
python reasoning_demo.py  # Start here!
```

### Option 2: OpenAI
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python chain_of_thought.py
```

### Option 3: Anthropic
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
python tree_of_thoughts.py
```

### Option 4: Local Models (Ollama)
```bash
# Install and start Ollama
ollama pull llama2
ollama serve

# Run examples (no API key needed)
python react.py
```

## üìñ Pattern Selection Guide

| Problem Type | Recommended Pattern | Example Use Case |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Mathematical | Chain of Thought | Calculate ROI, solve equations |
| Creative | Tree of Thoughts | Design UI, create content |
| Research | ReAct | Find information, validate data |
| Analytical | Chain of Thought | Debug code, analyze metrics |
| Strategic | Tree of Thoughts | Business planning, optimization |
| Investigative | ReAct | Troubleshoot issues, gather facts |
| Business Decisions | Tree of Thoughts | Market entry, product strategy |
| Compliance | Chain of Thought | Step-by-step verification |
| Customer Support | Pattern varies | Depends on issue complexity |

## üíº Real-World Business Applications

### Startup Decision Making
```python
# Using Tree of Thoughts for exploring startup ideas
explorer = ReasoningAgent(
    reasoning_pattern="tree_of_thoughts",
    pattern_config={"max_depth": 3, "beam_width": 4}
)
response = await explorer.think_and_act(
    "What's the best SaaS startup for the healthcare market?"
)
```

### Market Research
```python
# Using ReAct for data-driven decisions
researcher = ReasoningAgent(
    reasoning_pattern="react",
    tools=[MarketDataTool(), CostCalculatorTool()]
)
response = await researcher.think_and_act(
    "Analyze the sustainable fashion market opportunity"
)
```

### Problem Diagnosis
```python
# Using Chain of Thought for systematic analysis
analyst = ReasoningAgent(
    reasoning_pattern="chain_of_thought",
    pattern_config={"min_confidence": 0.8}
)
response = await analyst.think_and_act(
    "Why did our conversion rate drop 30% last month?"
)
```

## üè≠ Production Usage

For production applications, see `production_handlers.py` which demonstrates:
- Clean handler pattern (no decorator issues)
- Automatic pattern selection
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Performance tracking
- Extensible architecture

### Key Production Patterns

1. **Handler Pattern** (Recommended)
```python
def my_handler(agent, step, context):
    # Tool logic here
    result = perform_operation(context.get("input"))
    context["output"] = result
    return f"Completed: {result}"

agent.register_handler("my_tool", my_handler)
```

2. **Pattern Selection Logic**
```python
def select_pattern(problem: str) -> str:
    problem_lower = problem.lower()
    if any(word in problem_lower for word in ["calculate", "compute", "step"]):
        return "chain_of_thought"
    elif any(word in problem_lower for word in ["design", "create", "options"]):
        return "tree_of_thoughts"
    elif any(word in problem_lower for word in ["find", "search", "research"]):
        return "react"
    return "chain_of_thought"  # default
```

3. **Error Handling**
```python
try:
    response = await agent.think_and_act(problem, timeout=30)
except TimeoutError:
    # Fall back to simpler pattern
    response = await simple_agent.think_and_act(problem)
```

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Test all examples
python quickstart.py
# Then choose 'test'

# Or check your environment
python -c "import agenticraft; print('‚úÖ AgentiCraft installed')"
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Test specific pattern
python -c "
from agenticraft.agents.reasoning import ReasoningAgent
agent = ReasoningAgent(reasoning_pattern='chain_of_thought')
print('‚úÖ Reasoning patterns available')
"
```

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `reasoning_demo.py` to understand the patterns
2. **Compare Patterns**: Use `pattern_comparison.py` to see differences
3. **Mock First**: Test with mock mode before using API keys
4. **Production Ready**: Study `production_handlers.py` for real-world usage
5. **Combine Patterns**: Consider hybrid approaches for complex problems
6. **Monitor Performance**: Track pattern effectiveness over time
7. **Handle Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for each pattern
8. **Cache Results**: For expensive reasoning operations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Tool Integration Issues
**Problem**: `@tool` decorator causing issues with WorkflowAgent  
**Solution**: Use the handler pattern shown in `production_handlers.py`

### Pattern Selection
**Problem**: Using wrong pattern for the task  
**Solution**: Start with `pattern_comparison.py` to understand strengths

### Performance
**Problem**: Tree of Thoughts taking too long  
**Solution**: Reduce `max_depth` and `beam_width` parameters

### API Timeouts
**Problem**: Complex reasoning hitting API timeouts  
**Solution**: Break into smaller sub-problems or increase timeout

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "AgentiCraft not installed"
```bash
cd /path/to/agenticraft
pip install -e .
```

### "No API keys found"
- Examples work without API keys (mock mode)
- Or set up keys using `python quickstart.py` ‚Üí 'setup'

### "Import errors"
- Ensure you're in the right directory
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)

### "Provider not available"
- Check API key is set correctly
- For Ollama: ensure `ollama serve` is running
- Try mock mode first

## üìä Performance Considerations

| Pattern | Typical Time | Token Usage | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Chain of Thought | 0.5-2s | Low-Medium | Quick analysis |
| Tree of Thoughts | 2-10s | High | Complex decisions |
| ReAct | Variable | Medium-High | Data gathering |
