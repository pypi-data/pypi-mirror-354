# Regressalot

**Regressalot** is a lightweight AutoML utility designed for **preliminary analysis and model comparison**.  
It helps you quickly assess the performance of multiple machine learning models using default settings and diagnostics — ideal for early exploration before fine-tuning or scaling.

## Features
- One-line run of Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- Automatic feature encoding
- Evaluation metrics like R², RMSE, RMSPE, over/under-predictions, overfitting
- Ranking of models by performance
- Prediction plots

## Installation
```bash
pip install regressalot
