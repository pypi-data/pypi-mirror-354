Relocate source location of unconfirmed moves

Add relocation rules for moves.

Some use cases:

- Handle all the replenishments at the same place
- Trigger minimum stock rules or DDMRP buffers in one location

Behavior:

- When we try to assign a stock move and the move is not available, a
  rule matching the source location (sub-locations included), the
  picking type and an optional domain is searched
- If a relocation is found, the move source location is updated with the
  new one
- If the move was partially available, it is split in 2 parts:

..

   - one available part which keeps its source location
   - one confirmed part which is updated with the new source location

Notes:

Goes well with ``stock_available_to_promise_release``. When using the
mentioned module, we assume that we release moves (which creates the
whole chain of moves) only when we know that we have the quantities in
stock (otherwise the module splits the delivery). So generally, we have
the goods are available, but maybe not at the correct place: this module
is handy to organize internal replenishments.

Compatible with ``stock_dynamic_routing``: when the source location is
updated by this module, a dynamic routing may be applied.

Configuration
=============

The configuration of the source relocations is done in "Inventory >
Configuration > Source Relocation".

Creation of a rule:

Properties that define where the rule will be applied:

- Location: any unreserved move in this location or sub-location is
  relocated
- Picking Type: any unreserved move in this picking type is relocated
- Rule Domain: filter the moves to relocate with arbitrary domains

Note: all of the above must be met to relocate a move.

The Relocate Location field defines what the move source location will
be changed to. It must be a sub-location of the location.
