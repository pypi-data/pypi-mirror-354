"""
NameHook filters named used in the namespace system. If it encounters
names that are near-misses of commonly used names, it will raise a
QuestionableSyntax exception. Because these names refer to built-in
functions, the near-miss names will not generally cause any errors related
to names. Instead, the built-in function is called instead of the
near-miss named custom function. Tracing the unexpected behaviour back
to the near-miss name is by no means obvious because of the presence
of the built-in function.

Below is a list of common functions along with potential near-miss names
and some comments.

# 1. __init__: Near-miss name: __int__
Both __init__ and __int__ find common use. The hook will inspect the
typehint of the return value. '__init__' and '__int__' should return
'None' and 'int' respectively. '__int__' should expect only 'self' as an
argument, whereas '__init__' might expect other arguments.

# 2. __set_name__: Near-miss name: __setname__ When a class body has a
key, value pair with value being of a type implementing __set_name__,
then this method is called when the owning class returns from __new__ in
the metaclass, but before __init__ is called. Although there is no
built-in implementation of __set_name__, no error will  be raised by its
absence. The typehints of the __set_name__ method  are:

  def __set_name__(self, owner: type, name: str) -> None:
    ...

# 3. __getitem__: Near-miss name: __get_item__ Dictionary like classes
call this method when encountering the syntax:
  dictLike = DictLike()
  print(dictLike[key])  # equivalent to:
  DictLike.__getitem__(dictLike, key)

# 4. __setitem__: Near-miss name: __set_item__ Exactly like above:
  dictLike = DictLike()
  dictLike[key] = value  # equivalent to:
  DictLike.__setitem__(dictLike, key, value)

# 5. __del__: Near-miss name: __delete__ When implementing the descriptor
protocol, the get and set accessors are '__get__' and '__set__' respectively.
The delete-accessor is '__delete__', but mistakenly using '__del__' does
happen. Since __del__ is a built-in function relating to garbage
collecting, this near-miss will cause HIGHLY UNDEFINED BEHAVIOUR.
