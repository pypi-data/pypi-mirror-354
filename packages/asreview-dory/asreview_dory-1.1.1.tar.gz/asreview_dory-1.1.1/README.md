ASReview LAB team.

## Installation

You can install ASReview Dory via PyPI using the following command:

```bash

Look for the üêü icon to spot the Dory models.

## Usage

Once installed, the plugins will be available in the front-end of ASReview, as
well as being accessible via the command-line interface.

You can check all available models using:
```console
asreview algorithms
```

### Caching Models

You can pre-load models to avoid downloading them during runtime by using the
`cache` command. To `cache` specific models, such as `xgboost` and `sbert`, run:

```console
asreview dory cache nb xgboost sbert
```

To cache all available models at once, use:

```console
asreview dory cache-all
```

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with ASReview version 2 or later. Ensure that your ASReview
installation is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.

The development of this plugin is done in parallel with the development of the
ASReview software. We aim to maintain compatibility with the latest version of
ASReview, but please report any issues you encounter.
