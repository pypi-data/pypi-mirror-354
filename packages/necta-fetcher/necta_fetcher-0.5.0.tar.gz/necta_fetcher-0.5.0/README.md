# Necta-Fetcher: Python Client for NECTA Student Results

**Version: 0.5.0** | **Developer: Someless Ado**

`necta-fetcher` is a Python client library designed by someless for developers seeking to programmatically access student examination results from the National Examinations Council of Tanzania (NECTA) online portal. This library streamlines the typically complex process of web interaction by managing authentication, session persistence, CSRF token handling, and direct API communication to retrieve detailed student performance data.

## Core Philosophy & Design

The primary goal of `necta-fetcher` is to provide a clean, intuitive, and robust interface for developers. By abstracting the underlying web scraping mechanics, you can focus on integrating NECTA results into your applications, data analysis workflows, or educational tools without getting bogged down in the intricacies of web automation.

## Important Considerations & Disclaimers

Before integrating `necta-fetcher` into your projects, please carefully review the following:

*   **Dynamic Web Environment:** This library interacts with an external web portal by simulating browser behavior. The structure, API endpoints, or security mechanisms of this portal can be modified by its administrators at any time and without prior notice. Such external changes may impact the functionality of `necta-fetcher`, potentially requiring updates to the library to restore compatibility.
*   **Adherence to Terms of Service:** As a user of this library, you are solely responsible for understanding and adhering to all Terms of Service, usage policies, and data access regulations stipulated by the official NECTA portal.
*   **Responsible Usage Protocol:** This library facilitates interaction with a live, operational web service. It is crucial to employ `necta-fetcher` responsibly to prevent imposing an undue or disruptive load on the NECTA portal's infrastructure. Implement rate limiting or considerate request scheduling in your applications, especially for batch operations.
*   **Authentication Mechanism (Version 0.5.0):** Please be aware that the initial version (0.5.0) of this package utilizes an internally pre-configured set of authentication credentials for accessing the NECTA portal. This approach was adopted for initial development and demonstration purposes. **For any production, enterprise, or sensitive data applications, it is imperative to use a version of this library that explicitly supports secure, user-provided credential input mechanisms.** Future iterations of `necta-fetcher` aim to address this with more flexible and secure authentication options.

## Key Features at a Glance

*   **Automated Portal Authentication:** Handles the multi-step login process to the NECTA portal seamlessly.
*   **Targeted Student Result Retrieval:** Fetches detailed examination results for individual students based on their unique full index number, examination year, and specific examination level.
*   **Intelligent Session & Token Management:** Manages HTTP sessions for cookie persistence and automatically handles the acquisition and usage of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens required for secure interactions.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** Implements a hierarchy of custom exceptions for precise and informative error reporting, enabling developers to build resilient applications.
*   **Developer-Friendly Interface:** Offers a clean and Pythonic API centered around the `NectaClient` class.
