class OIDCSessionExpiredMiddleware:
    """
    Middleware for checking OpenID Connect user session expiration.

    That middleware detects when a user previously logged in using
    the OpenID Connect authentication backend got his session expired.

    In that case it will perform a redirection to a django view whose
    name must be set in the ``SWH_AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED_REDIRECT_VIEW``
    django setting (typically a logout view).

    The following query parameter will be set for that view:

      * ``next``: requested URL before the detection of the session expiration
      * ``remote_user``: indicates that the user was previously authenticated with OIDC
