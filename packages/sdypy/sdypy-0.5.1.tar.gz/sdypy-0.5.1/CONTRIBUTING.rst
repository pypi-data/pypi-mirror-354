SDyPy pull request guidelines
-----------------------------

Pull requests are always welcome, and the SDyPy community appreciates
any help you give. Note that a code of conduct applies to all spaces
managed by the SDyPy project, including issues and pull requests:
https://github.com/sdypy/sdypy/blob/master/docs/source/dev/code_of_conduct.rst.

When submitting a pull request, we ask you check the following:

1. **Unit tests**, **documentation**, and **code style** are in order.
   For details, please see follow the SciPy notes:
   https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/HACKING.rst.txt.

   It's also OK to submit work in progress if you're unsure of what
   this exactly means, in which case you'll likely be asked to make
   some further changes.

2. The contributed code will be **licensed under SDyPy's license**,
   https://github.com/sdypy/sdypy/blob/master/LICENSE.txt.
   If you did not write the code yourself, you ensure the existing
   license is compatible and include the license information in the
   contributed files, or obtain a permission from the original
   author to relicense the contributed code.
