What is a SEP?
--------------

SEP stands for SDyPy Enhancement Proposal.  A SEP is a design
document providing information to the SDyPy community, or describing
a new feature for SDyPy or its processes or environment.  The SEP
should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a
rationale for the feature. SEPs follow the idea of NEPs (NumPy Enhancement 
Proposals) and PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals). 

Acknowledgement: 
this SEP heavily based on NEP0 (by Jarrod Millman <millman@berkeley.edu>)!
Good practices from the Python ecosystem should be applied wherever possible!

We intend SEPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing major new
features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for
documenting the design decisions that have gone into SDyPy.  The SEP
author is responsible for building consensus within the community and
documenting dissenting opinions.

Because the SEPs are maintained as text files in a versioned
repository, their revision history is the historical record of the
feature proposal [1]_.


Types
^^^^^

There are three kinds of SEPs:

1. A **Standards Track** SEP describes a new feature or implementation
   for SDyPy.

2. An **Informational** SEP describes a SDyPy design issue, or provides
   general guidelines or information to the Python community, but does not
   propose a new feature. Informational SEPs do not necessarily represent a
   SDyPy community consensus or recommendation, so users and implementers are
   free to ignore Informational SEPs or follow their advice.

3. A **Process** SEP describes a process surrounding SDyPy, or
   proposes a change to (or an event in) a process.  Process SEPs are
   like Standards Track SEPs but apply to areas other than the SDyPy
   language itself.  They may propose an implementation, but not to
   SDyPy's codebase; they require community consensus.  Examples include
   procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and
   changes to the tools or environment used in SDyPy development.
   Any meta-SEP is also considered a Process SEP.


SEP Workflow
------------

The SEP process begins with a new idea for SDyPy.  It is highly
recommended that a single SEP contain a single key proposal or new
idea. Small enhancements or patches often don't need
a SEP and can be injected into the SDyPy development workflow with a
pull request to the SDyPy `repo`_. The more focused the
SEP, the more successful it tends to be.
If in doubt, split your SEP into several well-focused ones.

Each SEP must have a champion---someone who writes the SEP using the style
and format described below, shepherds the discussions in the appropriate
forums, and attempts to build community consensus around the idea.  The SEP
champion (a.k.a. Author) should first attempt to ascertain whether the idea is
suitable for a SEP. Writting to the sdypy-discussion mailing list with the `SEP`
tag is the best way to doing this `mailing list`_.

.. TODO: mailing list needs to be created

The proposal should be submitted as a draft SEP via a `GitHub pull
request`_ to the ``docs/seps`` directory with the name ``sep-<n>.rst``
where ``<n>`` is an appropriately assigned four-digit number (e.g.,
``sep-0000.rst``). The draft must use the :docs:`sep-template` file.

Once the PR for the SEP is in place, a post should be made to the
mailing list containing the sections up to "Backward compatibility",
with the purpose of limiting discussion there to usage and impact.
Discussion on the pull request will have a broader scope, also including
details of implementation.

At the earliest convenience, the PR should be merged (regardless of
whether it is accepted during discussion).  Additional PRs may be made
by the Author to update or expand the SEP, or by maintainers to set
its status, discussion URL, etc.

Standards Track SEPs consist of two parts, a design document and a
reference implementation.  It is generally recommended that at least a
prototype implementation be co-developed with the SEP, as ideas that sound
good in principle sometimes turn out to be impractical when subjected to the
test of implementation.  Often it makes sense for the prototype implementation
to be made available as PR to the SDyPy repo (making sure to appropriately
mark the PR as a WIP).


Review and Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SEPs are discussed as issues `SEP`_.  The possible paths of the
status of SEPs are as follows:

.. image:: _static/sep-0000.png

All SEPs should be created with the ``Draft`` status.

Eventually, after discussion, there may be a consensus that the SEP
should be accepted ‚Äì see the next section for details. At this point
the status becomes ``Accepted``.

Once a SEP has been ``Accepted``, the reference implementation must be
completed.  When the reference implementation is complete and incorporated
into the main source code repository, the status will be changed to ``Final``.

To allow gathering of additional design and interface feedback before
committing to long term stability for a language feature or standard library
API, a SEP may also be marked as "Provisional". This is short for
"Provisionally Accepted", and indicates that the proposal has been accepted for
inclusion in the reference implementation, but additional user feedback is
needed before the full design can be considered "Final". Unlike regular
accepted SEPs, provisionally accepted SEPs may still be Rejected or Withdrawn
even after the related changes have been included in a Python release.

Wherever possible, it is considered preferable to reduce the scope of a
proposal to avoid the need to rely on the "Provisional" status (e.g. by
deferring some features to later SEPs), as this status can lead to version
compatibility challenges in the wider NumPy ecosystem.

A SEP can also be assigned status ``Deferred``.  The SEP author or a
core developer can assign the SEP this status when no progress is being made
on the SEP.

A SEP can also be ``Rejected``.  Perhaps after all is said and done it
was not a good idea.  It is still important to have a record of this
fact. The ``Withdrawn`` status is similar---it means that the SEP author
themselves has decided that the SEP is actually a bad idea, or has
accepted that a competing proposal is a better alternative.

When a SEP is ``Accepted``, ``Rejected``, or ``Withdrawn``, the SEP should be
updated accordingly. In addition to updating the status field, at the very
least the ``Resolution`` header should be added with a link to the relevant
thread in the mailing list archives.

SEPs can also be ``Superseded`` by a different SEP, rendering the
original obsolete.  The ``Replaced-By`` and ``Replaces`` headers
should be added to the original and new SEPs respectively.

Process SEPs may also have a status of ``Active`` if they are never
meant to be completed, e.g. SEP 0 (this SEP).


How a SEP becomes Accepted
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A SEP is ``Accepted`` by consensus of all interested contributors. We
need a concrete way to tell whether consensus has been reached. When
you think a SEP is ready to accept, send an email to the
sdypy-discussion mailing list with a subject like:

  Proposal to accept SEP #<number>: <title>

In the body of your email, you should:

* link to the latest version of the SEP,

* briefly describe any major points of contention and how they were
  resolved,

* include a sentence like: "If there are no substantive objections
  within 7 days from this email, then the SEP will be accepted; see
  SEP 0 for more details."

.. For an example, see: https://mail.python.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2018-June/078345.html

After you send the email, you should make sure to link to the email
thread from the ``Discussion`` section of the SEP, so that people can
find it later.

Generally the SEP author will be the one to send this email, but
anyone can do it ‚Äì the important thing is to make sure that everyone
knows when a SEP is on the verge of acceptance, and give them a final
chance to respond. If there's some special reason to extend this final
comment period beyond 7 days, then that's fine, just say so in the
email. You shouldn't do less than 7 days, because sometimes people are
travelling or similar and need some time to respond.

In general, the goal is to make sure that the community has consensus,
not provide a rigid policy for people to try to game. When in doubt,
err on the side of asking for more feedback and looking for
opportunities to compromise.

If the final comment period passes without any substantive objections,
then the SEP can officially be marked ``Accepted``. You should send a
followup email notifying the list (celebratory emoji optional but
encouraged üéâ‚ú®), and then update the SEP by setting its ``:Status:``
to ``Accepted``, and its ``:Resolution:`` header to a link to your
followup email.

If there *are* substantive objections, then the SEP remains in
``Draft`` state, discussion continues as normal, and it can be
proposed for acceptance again later once the objections are resolved.

In unusual cases, the `SDyPy Steering Council`_ may be asked to decide
whether a controversial SEP is ``Accepted``.


Maintenance
^^^^^^^^^^^

In general, Standards track SEPs are no longer modified after they have
reached the Final state as the code and project documentation are considered
the ultimate reference for the implemented feature.
However, finalized Standards track SEPs may be updated as needed.

Process SEPs may be updated over time to reflect changes
to development practices and other details. The precise process followed in
these cases will depend on the nature and purpose of the NEP being updated.


Format and Template
-------------------

SEPs are UTF-8 encoded text files using the reStructuredText_ format.  Please
see the :doc:`sep-template` file and the reStructuredTextPrimer_ for more
information.  We use Sphinx_ to convert SEPs to HTML for viewing on the web
[2]_.


Header Preamble
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each SEP must begin with a header preamble.  The headers
must appear in the following order.  Headers marked with ``*`` are
optional.  All other headers are required.

.. code-block:: rst

    :Author: <list of authors' real names and optionally, email addresses>
    :Status: <Draft | Active | Accepted | Deferred | Rejected |
             Withdrawn | Final | Superseded>
    :Type: <Standards Track | Process>
    :Created: <date created on, in dd-mmm-yyyy format>
  * :Requires: <sep numbers>
  * :SDyPy-Version: <version number>
  * :Replaces: <sep number>
  * :Replaced-By: <sep number>
  * :Resolution: <url>

The Author header lists the names, and optionally the email addresses
of all the authors of the SEP.  The format of the Author header
value must be

.. code-block:: rst

    Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

if the email address is included, and just

.. code-block:: rst

    Random J. User

if the address is not given.  If there are multiple authors, each should be on
a separate line.
