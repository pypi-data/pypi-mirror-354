**Gtk-LLM-Chat** is a graphical frontend for the command-line llm utility. Just as `llm` integrates large language models into the [command line interface](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html), Gtk-LLM-Chat aims to bring that same power to the desktop environment. Its goal is to provide intuitive affordances and seamless integration for using LLMs in everyday tasks â€” all while remaining convenient, lightweight, and transparent in its behavior.

## Installation

### Downloadable application bundles

While the command line is fun in every operating system, **Gtk-LLM-Chat** also offers prepackaged binary application bundles for all three major operating sytems: Windows installers, Linux Appimages and Macos Application Bundles are available in our [_releases_](https://github.com/icarito/gtk-llm-chat/releases) section.

An effort has been made to support desktop integration across systems but _your mileage may vary_ - as the Gtk tools are still maturing outside of the GNU/Linux ecosystem.

### As an `llm` plugin

Playing with LLMs in the command line is fun! I recommend you to install `llm` and play around with it to size up the possibilities. Gtk-LLM-Chat can be installed as a plugin extension for `llm` itself, thus extending the possibilities of `llm` with some graphical features. Not all features of `llm` are exposed yet.

```
pipx install llm               # required by gtk-llm-chat
llm install gtk-llm-chat
```

You may want to copy the provided .desktop files to your ~/.local/share/applications/ folder. A welcome assistant will do this in the future for you.
