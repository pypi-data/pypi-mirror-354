What?
=====

This package is a placeholder for common supporting code for Darker_ and Graylint_.

Such pieces of code have been moved from Darker_ to this new package.

.. _Darker: https://pypi.org/project/darker
.. _Graylint: https://pypi.org/project/graylint


.. _#151: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/issues/151
.. _community support channel: https://github.com/akaihola/darker/discussions


Why?
====

Darker_ and Graylint_ originate from the same original Darker_ code base. In February
2023, linter support was decided to be moved out from Darker_. Obviously, the two tools
are still very similar and share a lot of under-the-hood functionality. For maintenance
purposes, those common pieces are being moved into this package.
