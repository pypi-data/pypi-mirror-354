This body cavity is called a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpseudocoelom\u00e2\u0080\u009d because it is not fully lined by mesodermal cells as in the true \u00e2\u0080\u009ccoelomic cavity\u00e2\u0080\u009d of vertebrates. The C. elegans pseudocoelom is bounded by basal laminae (BL) that cover the hypodermis, the nervous tissues, the gonad and the intestine (PeriFIG 2) (Bird and Bird, 1991). The pseudocoelom contains the coelomocytes (see Coelomocyte Section), provides the turgor-hydrostatic pressure for the animal as a whole, functions as a lubricant between tissues, and provides a medium for intercellular signaling and nutrient transport."

Similarly, the pseudocoelomic fluid cannot mix with the luminal contents of the digestive tract nor the reproductive tract due to the presence of another permeability barrier: the belt junctions connecting all epithelial cells in those tissues. The permeability barrier between the gut lumen and the pseudocoelom is particularly important since it prevents leakage of digestive enzymes, stray bacteria, or viruses into the body cavity. Thus, the pseudocoelom is effectively isolated from other body fluids, while bathing all tissues on their basal pole with similar contents. As a result, the pseudocoelom is positioned to carry out many of the functions normally performed by the circulatory system (bloodstream) or the respiratory system (airways) in higher animals. Motions of the nematode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body may effectively stir the contents, but otherwise there is no active circulation per se. The permeability barriers on both sides of the pseudocoelom also allow the pseudocoelomic fluid to be pressurized beneath the elastic cuticle; thus, the fluid acts as a hydrostatic skeleton that contributes to maintain the nematode\u00e2\u0080\u0099s overall rigidity (Crofton, 1966). In aging worms, this hydrostatic pressure is often decreased."

The cross-sectional volume of the pseudocoelom is larger along the midbody regions, but becomes much tighter and less voluminous in the head and in the tail tip. Because this fluid is in contact with all major tissues, it helps to establish an ionic equilibrium for the whole animal, balancing the osmotic contents of the various tissues. The chemical composition of the pseudocoelomic fluid has been analyzed in larger nematode species and was found to have a neutral pH and to contain proteins, fat, glucose, sodium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, and small quantities of copper, zinc, iron, hematin and ascorbic acid. The main buffering system in the pseudocoelomic fluid of larger nematodes was found to be bicarbonate:phosphate (Bird and Bird 1991)."

The pseudocoelom is in close physical contact with the excretory canals along the length of the midbody and in the head, and the CANs have close association with the canals (ExcFIG 4 and ExcFIG 7). The excretory canals also form extensive gap junctions to the hypodermis that may play a role in coupling their influences on fluid balance. Ablation of the excretory system cells or the CAN neurons, or hyperactivating EGL-15 (an FGF-like receptor tyrosine kinase) or CLR-1 (a receptor tyrosine phosphatase) in hypodermis results in a Clr (clear) phenotype, characterized by the accumulation of clear fluid within the pseudocoelomic space (Huang and Stern, 2004). The excretory system and hypodermis are thought to regulate fluid homeostasis by regulating fluid outflow and inflow, respectively. The hypodermis functions to either promote fluid intake or inhibit fluid excretion, whereas the excretory system functions in disposing solutes and water that pass into the canal cell from the pseudocoelom (see Excretory System)."

White, pers. comm.). This narrowed accessory pseudocoelom may share the same functions as the main pseudocoelom, and it is likely that extracellular signals can pass between them. For instance, some signals that seem to affect the entire animal could be released into this narrow space, including the lipophilic hormones secreted by the XXX cells (see Epithelial System - Atypical Cells; AtypFIG 3) (Jia et al 2002; Gerisch and Antebi, 2004). Similarly, the NSM neurons have neurohumoral release zones extending to both sides of the GLR constrictions, suggesting that it is important to release their product into the accessory space as well as into the main portion of the pseudocoelom. Additionally, fluorescently labeled antibodies injected into the body pseudocoelom can diffuse and label extracellular peripheral membrane ligands in the anterior head (Gottschalk and Schafer, 2006). The accessory pseudocoelomic space ends near the anterior limit of the pharyngeal muscles after narrowing further in a graded fashion."

Yolk granules then go through sheath pores to the surface of the oocyte, where they are taken up into vesicles within the growing oocytes (PeriFIG 2C) (Kimble and Sharrock, 1983; Sharrock, 1983; Hall et al., 1999). Yolk synthesis starts during L4 lethargus and continues through the adult life. The net direction of yolk transport is reversed during embryonic development; during\u00a0 midembryogenesis, nonintestinal cells resecrete the yolk they inherited from the oocyte into the perivitelline space, which is then taken up by the intestinal cells. At  hatching most of the yolk is therefore stored in the intestine (Bossinger and Schierenberg 1996; Grant and Hirsh, 1999). When reproductive life has ended, excess yolk begins to collect within the body cavity to form huge islands of material (Herndon et al., 2002)."

Some of these components, such as glycoproteins and carbohydrates, quickly become deposited into distinct extracellular layers near their origin of synthesis generating extracellular matrices (ECM), but others may diffuse more widely as intercellular signals. The major ECM are the basement membrane, which covers the basal surfaces of the tissues, and the cuticle on the outside of the animal (PeriFIG 2 and PeriFIG 3A) (see Cuticle). There are other, smaller matrices that are specific to certain tissues, such as the mantle, rachis coat, tendons and zona pellucida. A number of very long fibrous proteins and glycosaminoglycans (proteoglycans) are secreted into the extracellular space that may then  condense to form the basement membranes or may attach to the ECM in a less orderly fashion and extend into the pseudocoelomic fluid (Kramer, 2005). For instance, the very long DIG-1 protein is probably attached to the basement membrane, but has been hypothesized to extend far into the cavity (B\u00c3\u00a9nard et al., 2006).

In the nematode, it is generally impossible to distinguish these separate features, and thus the two terms basement membrane and basal lamina are often used interchangeably. In higher animals, the BL itself can be viewed by electron microscopy to constitute a multi-layered structure, but this is not true in C. elegans. Instead the BL appears as a unitary thin layer covering the basal surface (pseudocoelomic side) of tissues in the nematode (Huang et al., 2003).

The BL of the pharynx is particularly thick and robust (PhaFIG 5D). In certain regions, the BL shows specializations that may strengthen it or permit stronger binding between adjacent tissues. For example, the uterine epithelium is firmly attached to the lateral bodywall via a local thickening of the BL at the seam cell (EggFIG 3)."

Expression and genetic data suggest that laminins are essential for early embryonic basement membrane assembly and, in the absence of laminin deposition, no other basement membrane component can initiate the assembly of the basement membranes (Yurchenco and Wadsworth, 2004). After laminin deposition, other basement membrane components are integrated into the nascent laminin scaffold. One of these, collagen IV, which is synthesized by the gonad and the muscle, is absent from the BL of the hypodermis and the muscle in regions that face the pseudocoelomic space\u00a0 (PeriFIG 2) (Graham et al., 1997). Similar to the basement membranes in higher animals, the basement membranes of C. elegans are decorated by a variety of linking molecules including nidogen (entactin), collagen XVIII, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (perlecan) (Hutter et al., 2000; Yurchenco et al., 2004). Also attached to this matrix are a wide variety of signaling molecules and growth factors, including netrin, slit, wnt, SPARC and others (Schwarzbauer and Spencer, 1993; Wadsworth et al., 1996; Kang and Kramer, 2000; Pan et al., 2006; Quinn et al., 2006). The BL is often physically linked to the underlying plasma membrane by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), including integrins and dystroglycan, and perhaps via sulfated glycolipids and proteoglycans (syndecan) (Yurchenco et al., 2004; Kramer, 2005). Hemicentin, which is synthesized by the gonadal leaders and bodywall muscles, is integrated into specialized matrices, including the mantle of the touch  dendrites, the BL associated with the longitudinal nerve cords and nerve ring, the uterine-seam attachment, apical surfaces that surround the rachis of the germline, and the tendons around the pharynx (PeriFIG 3 and PeriFIG 4) (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001). It is also secreted by the anchor cell in early L3 stage securing the anchor cell to the BL prior to cell invasion during vulva morphogenesis (Sherwood et al., 2005). \n\n"

Fibrous organelle-like structures, formed by the neighboring hypodermis, are positioned periodically along the length of the touch receptor process, in close contact with the mantle on the cuticle side (NeuroFIG 9E-G). These are thought to be the sites at which the touch receptor process is anchored to the cuticle via the ECM (Tavernarakis and Driscoll, 1997). Mantle proteins are synthesized by the touch receptor neurons, hypodermis and muscle, and they include a mantle-specific collagen (MEC-5), hemicentin (HIM-4), and other matrix proteins such as MEC-9 and MEC-1 (Du et al., 1996; Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001). Mantle proteins organize the placement of the receptor (degenerin) channel complex in the nerve process and are believed to be important for mechanotransduction, although the attachment of the nerve process to the body wall per se is not essential for touch sensitivity (see Nervous System; Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001; Emtage et al., 2004; O\u00e2\u0080\u0099Hagan and Chalfie, 2006).\n\n3.2.2 Rachis Coat"

At hatching, hemicentin is seen in the lateral extracellular space between the germline cells. Later, as the germ cells proliferate, hemicentin accumulates as a 0.2- to 0.3-\u00ce\u00bcm-thick layer on the apical surfaces of the distal gonad in a quasihexagonal distribution. More proximally, a diffuse sheet of hemicentin surrounds the rachis along the meiotic germ cells. The hemicentin layer may help to reinforce the isolation of adjacent spindles in the cortical layer of the mitotic germline syncytium and prevent abortive cytokinesis and sporadic cell refusion, because frequent mitotic chromosome loss and binucleate germline cells are found in hemicentin mutants (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001).

These tendonous tracks run radially outward from the pharynx and pass directly between muscle pairs in each muscle quadrant in the head to reach the muscle-hypodermis BL. Besides the RIP neuron processes, they are the only documented structures to span the width of the pseudocoelom. Each tendon row contains at least six to eight tendons as judged by electron microscopy (TEM). The principal known components of these tendons are hemicentin and fibulin (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001; Muriel et al., 2005). As the animal moves, tendons anchored at each end by merging with BL can change dramatically in length. They flex during pharyngeal pumping and shift in orientation as the pharynx changes in length to tilt obliquely forwards or backwards. These motions suggest the tendons may help to hold the pharynx in position within the bodywall. In certain mutations that cause twisting of the overall pharynx structure, these tendons can stretch even more dramatically without rupture, retaining their anchorage points and becoming twisted around the outside of the distorted pharynx (Ax\u00c3\u00a4ng et al., 2007). Other hemicentin tracks run along the anterior-posterior axis between the intestine and bodywall, but are not clearly anchored on either end (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001; Hall, unpublished).\n\n3.2.4 Oocyte Covering (Zona Pellucida)"

                        "contents": "Immediately after fusion of an oocyte and a spermatozoon within the spermatheca, the diploid cell displays a new covering, perhaps combining elements from the zona pellucida with exocytosis from intracellular stores of glycoprotein from the oocyte (PeriFIG 5) (Weidman et al., 1985). Although the presence of cortical granules within the oocyte have still not been shown in C. elegans (a possible source for this material), TEM evidence for an intact fertilization membrane has been obtained by high pressure freeze fixations of normal hermaphrodite adults (Hall and Greenstein, unpublished). This glycocalyx is also quickly removed, probably within a few minutes, as the new embryo begins to produce an eggshell underneath it. The glycocalyx breaks away into the uterine lumen and is probably dissolved or expelled from the lumen during egg-laying. Rapid production of a fertilization membrane can offer a physical block  to fertilization by more than one sperm until the eggshell is in place. \n\n"

                        "contents": "Shortly after oocyte maturation and fertilization, a chitinous eggshell is assembled around the embryo and persists until hatching. The eggshell provides an osmotic barrier and a mechanical support that helps the embryo to resist desiccation or predation until the worm is ready to hatch, while still allowing gas exchange for respiration (Schierenberg and Junkersdorf, 1992). Before the two-cell stage, presence of an eggshell is essential for proper development (Zhang et al, 2005). The eggshell has three layers in C. elegans: an outer vitelline layer, a middle chitin-containing layer, and an inner lipid-rich layer (PeriFIG5) (Bird and Bird, 1991; Rappleye et al., 1999; Johnston et al., 2006). Other nematode species can have eggshells with up to five layers."

                        "contents": "Activation of eggshell deposition is triggered in the oocyte even if the spermatocyte lacks a nucleus (Sadler and Shakes, 2000). After sperm penetration and after the fertilization membrane is shed, the egg\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plasma membrane is thought to separate from the cytoplasm to become the thickened vitelline layer (Johnston et al., 2006). The space underlying the vitelline layer becomes filled with chitin (an N-acetyl-D-glucoseamine homopolymer) and chitin-binding proteins, forming the middle layer of the eggshell (Veronico et al 2001; Berninsone, 2006). Concomitant with middle-layer formation, embryonic cytoplasmic refringent granules are extruded to form the inner proteolipid permeability barrier layer, commonly called the lipid layer. Shortly after forming, the eggshell itself separates from the newly formed plasma membrane of the embryo to form a clear zone called the perivitelline space. This space contains the perivitelline fluid in later-stage embryos. Depending on the fixation technique, the lipid layer may appear to remain as part of the eggshell proper (high-pressure freeze fixation) or may form a deposit held against the embryonic plasma membrane, beneath the perivitelline space (laser-hole chemical fixation). In some mutants (as in pod-1), the lipid layer seems to split to occupy both locales (Rappleye et al., 1999)."

                        "contents": "The embryonic sheath is secreted over the surface of the embryo by the hypodermis prior to elongation and is connected to the hypodermis directly above the circumferential actin bundles (Priess and Hirsh, 1986; Gatewood and Bucher, 1997). This extracellular layer is suggested to function in transmitting the stress of elongation longitudinally and/or sustaining the internal pressure during elongation. Trypsin treatment and digestion of embryonic sheath results in embryos with improper or arrested elongation. At the three-fold stage, the cuticle assumes the function of maintaining the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s morphology."
