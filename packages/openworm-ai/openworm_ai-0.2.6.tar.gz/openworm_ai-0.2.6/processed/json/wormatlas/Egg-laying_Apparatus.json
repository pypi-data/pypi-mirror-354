                        "contents": "The egg-laying apparatus consists of the uterus, the uterine muscles, the vulva, the vulval muscles, and a local neuropil formed by the egg-laying neurons (EggFIG 1). After fertilization, embryos pass from the spermatheca to the uterus, an epithelial egg chamber that links the two arms of the gonad. There, eggs develop to the approximately 30-cell stage (roughly 2.5 hr post-fertilization at 20\u00c2\u00b0C) before being expelled into the environment via the vulva, a passageway from the uterus to the ventral exterior. Under optimal conditions, an adult hermaphrodite will lay 4-10 eggs/hour. Egg-laying is facilitated by contraction of the sex muscles: the vulval muscles, which attach to the lips of the vulva, and the uterine muscles, which encircle the uterus. Muscle activity is regulated by motor neurons, in particular motor neurons VCn (VC1-6) and HSNL/R, which synapse onto each other and onto vulval muscle arms, forming a neuropil near the vulva. Tissues comprising the egg-laying apparatus arise from several different lineages (see ReproTABLE 1). As described below, the developing gonad and vulva act as organizing centers, recruiting cells from other regions to the midbody, coordinating cell patterning between different tissues, and directing axon guidance and synaptic patterning of the neurons."

The central chamber is joined ventrally to the vulval  epithelial tube (EggFIG 2A,B and EggFIG 3A). The entire outer (basal) surface of the uterus is covered by a thin basal lamina called the uterine basal lamina (UBL) (EggFIG 3B; see also EggFIG 11C). The organization of cells that comprise the uterus is most readily apparent during the late-L4 stage, after uterine and vulval morphogenesis have taken place but before the onset of ovulation, after which the uterus becomes distorted and crowded with embryos. The anterior and posterior uterus lobes are each composed of four uterine toroid epithelial syncytia: ut1, ut2, ut3 and ut4 (EggFIG 2A,B; EggTABLE 1). ut1\u00e2\u0080\u0093ut4 are joined to one another and to their neighbors both by adherens junctions (EggFIG 2C) and by pleated septate junctions, most robust between ut4 and ut3 and less obvious at the other borders. Cytoskeletal elements are sometimes evident in ut toroids, running circumferentially, suggesting that the toroids may have myoepithelial properties (Newman et al., 1996)."

The utse has a distinctive H-shaped structure. The two sides of the H attach to the lateral seam of the animal and hold the uterus in place. At the join, the basal lamina is thickened and contains hemicentin (EggFIG 3B) (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001). The central portion of the utse (the crossbar of the H) initially forms a hymen membrane between uterine and vulval lumens. Passage of the first egg breaks this membrane and the two lumens become continuous."

Both the developing and the mature uterine lumen have a continuous thickening or electron-dense layer (possibly a glycocalyx or surface coat; see EggFIG 11C).

The differentiation of these and many other terminal uterine cells involves dramatic changes in shape and/or fusion to achieve their final  morphology (Newman et al., 1996). As described below, the AC also patterns cells of the vulva. This dual induction of vulval and uterine cell fates by the AC ensures that cells forming the physical connection between the uterus and vulva (utse, uv1, and vulF) develop in physical register. The AC also contributes to formation of this connection by creating an opening at the apex of the vulva."

Each ring is either a single tetranucleate syncytium or two binucleate half-ring syncytia (vulB1 and vulB2). The vulval lumen is lined with cuticle. As described below, the toroids are formed by vulval cells of two fates: primary fate (vulE and vulF) or secondary fate (vulA\u00e2\u0080\u0093D). These cells and the toroids they form express distinct combinations of genes (Inoue et al., 2002) and, potentially, different characteristics and properties. For example, during copulation, males locate the vulva with their hook and post-cloacal sensilla, possibly in response to signals or characteristics associated specifically with toroids formed by secondary-fated cells (M. Barr, pers. comm.)."

Establishment of the vulva requires the local deformation of existing ventral structures such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (EggFIG 1) and ventral body wall muscles (EggFIG 3A), which are deflected laterally in this region to accommodate the vulva.  Vulval development can be divided into two phases: (1) vulval cell patterning and generation (EggFIG 7 and EggFIG 8) and (2) vulval morphogenesis (EggFIG 9). The molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying these processes, particularly cell patterning, have been studied extensively and are described in the following reviews and papers and references therein (Greenwald, 1997; Kim, 1997; Eisenmann et al., 1998; Levitan and Greenwald, 1998; Hanna-Rose and Han, 2000; Shemer and Podbilewicz, 2003; Ceol and Horvitz, 2004; Sundaram, 2004)."

The six central cells P3p\u00e2\u0080\u0093P8p are endowed with equal potential to produce vulval cell lineages and are referred to as vulval precursor cells (VPCs) (EggFIG7A and EggFIG 8A). In L3, the VPCs are patterned so that vulval potential is restricted to the central three cells P5p\u00e2\u0080\u0093P7p. This patterning of the VPCs involves the combined action of three intercellular signaling events: an inductive signal emanating from the AC (LIN-3/LET-23 MAPK pathway activation), lateral signaling between VPCs (LIN-12/Notch), and signals from hyp 7 (reviewed in Greenwald, 1997; Sundaram, 2004; Sternberg, 2005)."

This invagination step establishes the beginnings of the vulval lumen, which continues to expand during morphogenesis. Proteoglycans and their associated glycosaminoglycans, likely expressed in vulval cells, are necessary for this step, although their precise role is not known (Herman and Horvitz, 1999; Bulik et al., 2000; Hwang et al., 2003). As morphogenesis continues, cells migrate toward the center of the developing vulval primordium and wrap around to meet their anterior/posterior homologs on the other side (EggFIG 9) (Sharma-Kishore et al., 1999). Homotypic cell fusions occur between cells of homologous fate, resulting in the formation of toroid or half-toroid rings (see Inoue et al., 2002 for a useful guide to vulval cell nuclei positions during and after morphogenesis)."

In L3, while Pnp cells are dividing, the ventral hypodermal basal lamina and gonadal basal lamina break down precisely at the site of contact with the AC. The basolateral portion of the AC crosses through this gap, attaches to, then inserts between the descendants of the primary-fated P6p lineage cells. This invasion is stimulated by a diffusible signal from the primary cells (Sherwood and Sternberg, 2003). Later, P6p terminal progeny fuse, forming a toroid (vulF) around the invading AC process. The AC is then removed by heterotypic fusion with the utse, leaving a channel in the apex of the vulva (Newman et al., 1996). When the utse membrane is ruptured by passage of the first egg, uterine and vulval lumens become continuous. \n\nDuring late L4, the vulval muscles attach to the vulval epithelial tube and to the body wall (see below). The tube then partially everts (turns inside out), generating the adult vulva in which the lumen is closed until vulval muscles contract (EggFIG 10) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Sharma-Kishore et al., 1999)."

Only 4 the 16 sex muscles receive direct inputs from the egg-laying neurons. The remaining sex muscles are electrically coupled, either directly or indirectly, to these innervated muscles (see EggFIG 13). This configuration may serve to coordinate uterine and vulval contraction. The sex muscles are classified as nonstriated muscles because they do not have the striated appearance (typified by body wall muscle) normally attributed to the presence of an ordered array of multiple sarcomeres (muscle contractile units; see Muscle System - Somatic Muscle). Vulval muscles have a single sarcomere that extends along the entire muscle length and attaches to a discrete zone in the body wall at one end and to the vulva at the other end (White, 1988). The uterine muscle myofilament network seems to be anchored to a thin basal lamina on the surface facing the uterus. In contrast to the vulval muscles, the attachment points are randomly arrayed and this distribution of dense bodies is similar to that seen in vertebrate smooth muscles (see Muscle System - Nonstriated)."

The ventral-proximal edges of the um2 muscles overlap with the um1 muscles (EggFIG 1). Uterine muscles are covered in a thin basal lamina (EggFIG 11C). The muscle filaments are circumferentially oriented so their contraction potentially moves eggs by squeezing on the uterus (EggFIG 11C) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977).

There, the SMs undergo three rounds of division to produce the vulval and uterine muscle cells (EggFIG 14D) which then attach to the everted vulva (EggFIG 14E) (for details on muscle specification programs, see Harfe et al., 1998; Corsi et al., 2000; Lui and Fire, 2000; Kosta and Fire, 2001; Eimer et al., 2002)."

The DUs, VUs, and AC of the SPh (EggFIG 14A) and primary-fated P6p vulval cells (EggFIG 7A) express FGF-related ligand EGL-17, which is likely to correspond to the GDA signal for SM migration.
