These systems communicate through a single pair of RIP interneurons (NeuroFIG 1) (Ward et al., 1975; Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Sulston et al., 1983; White et al., 1986). (For a discussion of the pharyngeal nervous system, see Alimentary System - Pharynx ) The two nervous systems differ in their topologies. In the somatic nervous system, the neurons and their processes are generally positioned between the hypodermis and the body wall muscle and share a basal lamina with the hypodermis that isolates them from the muscles (NeuroFIG 2). In contrast, the pharyngeal neurons lie directly among the pharyngeal muscles and are not separated from their muscle targets by a basal lamina. The neurons in the hermaphrodite have been assigned to 118 distinct classes according to their topology and synaptic connection patterns (White et al., 1986). Cell bodies of most neurons are clustered in ganglia in the head or tail (NeuroFIG 1). C. elegans has 56 neuronal support cells (including the GLR cells; see Muscle System - GLR Cells), which are associated only with the somatic nervous system. The neurons communicate through approximately 6400 chemical synapses, 900 gap junctions, and 1500 neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Among individual animals, the location of chemical synapses is about 75% reproducible (Durbin, 1987). Every C. elegans neuron name consists of either two or three uppercase letters indicating class and in some cases a number indicating the neuron number within one class. If the neurons are radially symmetrical, each cell has a three-letter name followed by L (left), R (right), D (dorsal), or V (ventral). A complete list of C. elegans neurons, their lineage, and descriptions can be found in the Individual Neuron section of the WormAtlas."

Most of these extra, male-specific cells are involved in male mating behavior and are located in the posterior body (Sulston et al., 1980; Lipton and Emmons, 2003; Emmons, 2005). The four CEM (cephalic neuron in male) neurons are an exception; they are located in the head as part of the male cephalic sensilla. The hermaphrodite has only two classes of hermaphrodite-specific neurons: HSN, which are generated in males but go through programmed cell death during early development, and VC neurons, which are derived from the P lineages that give rise to cells of the hook sensillum in males. All of the neurons in both sexes have been individually identified and their lineages described. The connectivity among the hermaphrodite neurons has been established from electron micrographs of serial thin sections, whereas the connectivity of the male nervous system has been the focus of more recent studies (Ward et al., 1975; Ware et al., 1975; White et al., 1986; Durbin, 1987; Hall and Russell, 1991; Chen et al., 2006; see also Male Anatomy."

The animal can discriminate and move toward or away from chemicals, odorants, temperatures, and food sources. It can also detect the presence, density, and sex of nearby nematodes by short-range diffusible signals, by a pheromone, and by changes in oxygen levels (Riddle and Golden, 1982; Cheung et al., 2004; Gray et al., 2004; Jeong et al., 2005; Barr and Garcia, 2006). The animal displays social feeding behavior (de Bono, 2003). Each sex also displays sex-specific behaviors such as egg-laying in hermaphrodites and mating behavior in males (Schafer, 2005). Most of these behaviors are plastic and therefore subject to change through learning and memory (Giles et al., 2006). Additionally, food is a significant modulator of many C. elegans behaviors, including egg-laying, feeding, locomotion, and olfactory behavior, often through serotonin-dependent pathways (Zhang et al., 2005). The neuron circuits that are dedicated to each of these behaviors may communicate via interneurons to produce hierarchies in their execution. For example, in stressful environments where food is scarce, egg-laying behavior is suppressed, whereas after an encounter with food, locomotion behavior becomes suppressed in a starved animal, allowing the animal to feed properly."

A few motor neurons, including VC4 and HSN neurons, make several simple branches as they reach their muscle targets. PVD and FLP neurons are unique in C. elegans because they branch extensively near each body muscle quadrant after early larval stages. Many neurons in the adult male tail are also more highly branched within the preanal ganglion, where some neurons can have four to eight separate branches within the neuropil (S.W. Emmons, J.E. Sulston, D.G. Albertson, M. Xu, and D.H. Hall, unpubl.). Some neuron processes may have pure sensory functions (a dendrite) or pure synaptic output functions (an axon), but many have mixed functions capable of both receiving inputs and sending outputs (a neurite or process)."

In transmission election microscopy (TEM) sections, they are seen as having relatively lightly staining cytoplasm, with a compact nucleus, distinctive rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), several mitochondria, small clusters of synaptic vesicles, and one or more Golgi bodies. Most of the neuronal nucleus is filled with light-staining \u00e2\u0080\u009ceuchromatin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a modest amount of dark \u00e2\u0080\u009cheterochromatin,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and one or more small round nucleoli. Under differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, neuronal nuclei can easily be distinguished as small, stippled ovals (NeuroFIG 1). The processes of individual neurons are generally very thin (100\u00e2\u0080\u0093200 nm in diameter), but show local swellings with clusters of vesicles at synaptic regions along the length of the process (White et al., 1986). Within each neurite or major side branch, a small bundle of microtubules (MTs) runs continuously along its length. In addition, each neurite contains a small tube of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and occasional mitochondria. A few small clusters of free ribosomes sometimes lie within the neurite not far from synapses, either on the presynaptic or post-synaptic side (Rolls et al., 2002). The exact position of synaptic swellings or short side branches is not identical among animals; however, the polarity, handedness, and position of a cell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main processes are very predictable.\n\n2.1 Nervous System Development 2.1.1 Cell Birth, Programmed Cell Death and Cell Migration"

The first is during the proliferation phase of embryogenesis, the second at the late-L1 stage, and the third at the L2 stage (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Sulston et al., 1983). At the time of hatching, the hermaphrodite worm has 222 neurons (202 somatic, 20 pharyngeal) and most of these derive from the AB lineage (the male worm has 224 neurons at this stage). All of the glial cells arise from the AB lineage. MS (six neurons) and C (two neurons) lineages contribute only a few neurons to the nervous system. During late L1, five classes of ventral nerve cord (VNC) motor neurons are generated from P and W lineages (see Postembryonic Neurons Table). Also at this time, additional neurons are generated from Q, G1, H2, T, and K lineages. In the L2 stage, the G2 blast cell divides to give rise to the excretory socket cell and RMF neuron pair, and V5paa generates the cells of the posterior deirids on both sides (see Epithelial system - Hypodermis). In males, the additional neurons that function in male mating are born during the L3 stage (Sulston et al., 1980). As a general rule in C. elegans neurogenesis, most bilaterally symmetric pairs of neurons arise from bilaterally symmetric cell lineages, but there are exceptions to this rule."

                        "contents": "Developmentally, neuronal cell movements can be divided into early mass migrations and later individual cell migrations. During embryogenesis, mass neuroblast movements occur to close the ventral cleft (at ~230\u00e2\u0080\u0093290 min after first cell cleavage, dorsal and lateral neurons sink towards inside and adjacent hypodermal cells cover the ventral side). They also occur later at comma stage when anterior neuron groups move toward the tip of the head to form rudiments of the head sensilla (see Epithelial system - Hypodermis). During this time, a sensory depression forms at the tip of the head to provide more surface area for the newly forming sensilla, and later everts (Sulston et al., 1983). Cell bodies of the head sensilla neurons later migrate posteriorly, leaving their dendritic processes stretching behind as attached to the lips. Two extracellular matrix proteins , DYF-7 and DEX-1, are required to anchor these nascent dendritic processes to the lips, since in dyf-7 or dex-1 mutants dendrites remain short and stubby and are dragged along by the neuron cell bodies as they pull away (Heiman & Shaham, 2009). Additionally, the anchoring of dendrites of amphid neurons of each side is highly coordinated, since failure of one dendrite to anchor leads to the failure of attachment of the remaining dendrites of the same side. Subsequent to these events, during elongation, the head neurons are pushed aside as the pharynx grows forward through the mass of neurons surrounding the developing nerve ring (NR). By late embryogenesis, the neurons around the NR settle into their recognizable positions. In later stages, despite the mechanical force generated by body movements, the  organization of cells in head ganglia is mostly maintained through homophilic and heterophilic interactions of cell adhesion molecules expressed on the surfaces of the neurons (Sasakura et al., 2005). There are some exceptions to this however; in live animals, cells can sometimes be seen to flip from one side of the anterior bulb to the other as the pharynx moves (Z. Altun, unpublished observations; White et al., 1986)."

This group includes canal-associated neurons (CAN), which move from the anterior end to a location midway along the body; HSN neurons, which move from the posterior end to close to the vulva; and anterior lateral microtubule (ALM) neurons, which move posteriorly from the anterior edge of the intestine to midway within the anterior body. QR and QL neuroblasts also migrate extensively (NeuroFIG 4). QR and QL are born about 1 hour before hatching at symmetric locations on the right and left sides of the posterior body, respectively, but after cell migrations their terminally differentiated progeny reside in nonsymmetric positions. Soon after hatching, QR migrates anteriorly, whereas QL migrates posteriorly. Their descendents continue migrating asymmetrically to anterior positions on the right side and posterior positions on the left (Salser and Kenyon, 1992). Each Q lineage produces a mechanosensory neuron (AVM/PVM), a sensory neuron (AQR/PQR), an interneuron (SDQR/L), and two programmed cell deaths."

DD motor neurons acquire their final synaptic connection pattern at the late-L1 stage, after the birth of VD neurons, and AVM neurons become connected to the anterior touch circuit at the late-L4 stage (Chalfie and White, 1988; Walthall et al., 1993).\n\n2.1.2 Process Outgrowth, Establishment of Process Tracts and Guidance at the Midline"

First, although the majority of neurons are in pairs and localize on the right and left sides of the animal in a bilaterally symmetric manner, there are many unilaterally placed single neurons. Additionally, members of some neuron pairs, such as SDQL/SDQR and AQR/PQR, are positioned far away from one another in a nonsymmetrical manner (NeuroFIG 4). Second, the two major cords of the animal, the VNC and dorsal cord (DC), are asymmetrical in their composition or location (NeuroFIG 4 and NeuroFIG 5). The DC is located at the left side of the dorsal hypodermal ridge, whereas the VNC has a thick fascicle on the right side of the ventral hypodermal ridge and a thin fascicle on the left. Third, the neurons in the body choose the side of the body on which to send their processes; although the pair of HSN neurons extends its neurites ipsilaterally along the two VNC tracts, many neuron pairs, such as PVD and PDE, have both of their neurites in the right tract, which requires the left-sided process to cross the midline. Similarly, the VNC motor neurons, which are localized at the midline, make \u00e2\u0080\u009cchoices\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding the side on which to grow their circumferential processes, whereas all of them extend their ventral processes along the right VNC tract.

AVG and PVT neurons mark the anterior and posterior boundaries of the VNC. AVG is the anterior guidepost neuron that pioneers the right tract of the VNC, whereas PVPR pioneers the left tract from the posterior, followed by the PVQL process (Durbin, 1987; Wadsworth and Hedgecock, 1996; Wadsworth et al., 1996). PVQ axons pioneer the lumber commissures and continue to travel alongside the PVP processes in the VNC. Although the PVPR axon is absolutely required for proper outgrowth of left-tract neurites, the AVG axon is essential for the correct outgrowth of only a subset of processes into the right tract (Hutter, 2003; Hutter et al., 2005). PVT, a single neuron in the preanal ganglion, serves as a guidepost neuron to growing axons from the lumbar ganglia in the posterior of the VNC. When PVT is ablated embryonically, these axons follow multiple routes to enter the VNC instead of making tight bundles in the two lumbar commissures (Wadsworth et al., 1996; Antebi et al., 1997; Ren et al., 1999). PVT is also required for maintenance of neurite architecture in the VNC post-embryonically, because in the absence of PVT, embryonically generated neurites are unable to maintain their positioning along the cord at the L1 stage and erroneously cross over the midline into the opposite fascicle (Aurelio et al., 2002; Hobert and B\u00c3\u00bclow, 2003). BDU processes are required for correct positioning of AVM branches in the NR (Chalfie and White, 1988). Notably, RIF neurons, which are the first processes to cross the ventral midline between the NR and the beginning of the VNC, are not essential for providing the pathway for guiding processes into the right VNC fascicle at the anterior decussation (Durbin, 1987; Hutter, 2003). The two neuron pairs, which decussate shortly after RIF, SABVs, and RIGs, are also not essential for this function."

In the developing embryo, these axons that form the nerve ring must navigate to the NR within commissural and longitudinal nerve bundles, recognize the region of the NR, make L/R side choices to enter the NR, make specific contacts with each other to form synapses and maintain these contacts during later growth. Additionally, head and neck muscle development has to be coordinated with the longitudinal and commissural tract and nerve ring development. Currently, little is known about the procession and control of the NR development. Based on studies of embryos at 350 min and 430 min (after first cleavage,) it has been suggested that SIBD neurons act as pioneers to might provide a substrate for the formation of early amphid commissure, while RIH and RMEV might help navigate the first axons entering the NR from the ventral side (Norris, C., Hall, D. H., Hedgecock, E. unpublished observations) (NeuroFIG 15-2).  In the early neurula, head muscle cells directly surround the pharynx where the NR will form and hence may restrict the access of lateral axons to reach the NR until the muscle cells move dorsally and ventrally to the periphery to their usual positions next to the hypodermis. As they migrate, they are suggested to leave railing processes behind attached to the NR, forming the arms of the head muscles (see Somatic Muscle)."

Mutant studies have uncovered several genes that seem to be involved in proper process outgrowth and suppression of excess axon branching (Altun-Gultekin et al., 2001; Knobel et al., 2001; B\u00c3\u00bclow et al., 2002). Neurons that extend commissures use the classical UNC-6/netrin and SLT-1/slit pathways, which act redundantly, as well as additional pathways that act in parallel to these, for circumferential guidance along the dorsoventral axis (for review, see Chisholm and Jin, 2005). Intrinsically, cytoskeletal rearrangements are regulated by Rac GTPases and the actin-binding protein UNC-115 (Yang and Lundquist, 2005). Extracellularly, guidance cues are modified by heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which affect neurite branching and patterning in a cellular context-dependent manner (B\u00c3\u00bclow and Hobert, 2006.) Although the mechanisms for branch-point control are still unclear, branching generally occurs under four circumstances: (1) Processes may enter midway along an existing nerve and bifurcate and grow in both directions; (2) processes are confronted with two equivalent neighborhoods, such as the entrance to the NR, and they may split and grow into both; (3) within the NR, processes may also bifurcate to enter two different neighborhoods; and finally, (4) processes in longitudinal nerves may bifurcate and grow a branch circumferentially into another nerve (Hedgecock et al., 1987).\n\n 2.1.3 Developmental Plasticity"

The end of the first larval stage also marks the rewiring of the synaptic contacts of DD motor neurons after the birth of VD motor neurons. This rewiring is intrinsically controlled and is not dependent on VD, VA, or VB neurons (White et al., 1978). Additionally, the neurons maintain similar densities of synapses during the fivefold increase in body length as the animal goes through four larval stages, suggesting that the nervous system maintains a certain level of plasticity throughout life and adjusts itself to the overall growth.\n\n2.2 Neuron Categories"

These motor neurons synapse onto either both dorsal or both ventral muscle quadrants, thereby restricting the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s flexures to the dorsoventral plane, creating sinusoidal waves as the animal lies on its lateral side on the substrate. When the dorsal muscles are activated, the ventral muscles are reciprocally inhibited and vice versa. Bending against the substrate results in forward locomotion as a result of propagation of sequential contraction and relaxation waves passing backward along the body. D-type motor neurons have processes that are post-synaptic corecipients at the dyadic NMJs of stimulatory (A- or B-type) motor neurons, and the ventral D and dorsal D neurons work as reciprocal cross-inhibitors. Their GABAergic synaptic outputs are onto diametrically opposite muscles, so that when a ventral or dorsal muscle group is activated by a cholinergic motor neuron, the opposite group of muscles is inhibited and relaxed (NeuroFIG 6) (White et al., 1978; McIntire et al., 1993). D-type motor neurons are most important for resetting the animal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s posture, for example, when reversing direction or initiating rapid movement (Jorgensen and Nonet, 1995; Jorgensen, 2006). In response to a touch, an animal that lacks GABA input shrinks due to unopposed contraction of both dorsal and ventral muscles. Once an animal gets moving, GABA input does not interfere with wave propagation; however, it does affect the amplitude of the body waves."

Synaptic innervation of motor neurons by command interneurons occurs throughout the length of the VNC. Command interneurons establish the direction of locomotion, but are not thought to be involved in wave propagation down the length of the animal (Jorgensen and Nonet, 1995). It is currently unclear which neurons are involved in wave propagation, although proprioceptive inputs are thought to have a role. The command interneurons are not equivalent because ablation of AVA or AVB produces uncoordinated animals (after a bout of forward or backward motion, animals kink while trying to reverse their direction) that are touch responsive, whereas ablation of PVC or AVD mainly abolishes the touch-mediated locomotory responses, but does not result in any change in spontaneous locomotion (Chalfie et al. 1985)."

Command interneurons that make synapses onto them enter the VNC after motor neuron outgrowth is completed. During the L1 stage, DA and DB innervate dorsal muscles and DD innervates ventral muscles. DD dendrites receive input from DA and DB at dyadic synapses onto the dorsal muscle arms. After hatching, the other five classes (additional 56 motor neurons) are generated by 13 (W and Pn) blast cells (see Epithelial System - Hypodermis ). The anterior daughters of the first division of P cells (Pna) give rise to 53 of these (Sulston et al., 1983). The processes from these later-born cells insert themselves into the cord between existing fibers to establish contacts with appropriate command interneurons and muscle cells. After post-embryonic motor neurons are born, DD neurons reverse their synaptic polarity without undergoing any structural change in process placement (White et al., 1978). They rearrange their synaptic machinery to receive input from the nascent VA and VB motor neurons and send output to dorsal muscles. An additional excitatory class of neurons, SABVL/VR/D, innervates anterior ventral body muscles only in the L1 stage; after this stage, they function as interneurons."

Hence, PVD neurons, which are presynaptic to command interneurons AVA and PVC, are proposed to be the mechanoceptors for harsh body touch (Way and Chalfie, 1989). In adult animals, PVD neurons show extensive branching along the body wall, from the tail to the neck of the animal, covering dorsal and ventral territories (NeuroFIG 3 and NeuroFIG 10) (Halevi et al., 2002). Multiple short branches arise from the main branches at the level of the muscle quadrants and these branches give rise to further branches subventrally and subdorsally.

OLQ may also function in mechanosensory feedback for foraging, as the rate and amplitude of foraging in unstimulated animals is affected in OLQ-ablated animals. FLP neurons also respond to gentle nose touch and activate an escape behavior (Chatzigeorgiou and Schafer, 2011).

Some neuron processes with morphologically nonspecialized, synapse-free, bare-wire portions are thought to transduce proprioceptive stimuli. Such properties have been hypothesized for many neurons, including the A- and B-type motor neurons, PHC, some pharyngeal neurons, and male tail neurons (NeuroFIG 6) (Hall, 1977; Sulston et al., 1980; Albertson and Thomson, 1984; Hall and Russell, 1991; R. Lints and D.H. Hall, unpubl.). Some of these may function to sense the degree of bending during undulatory movement, providing sensory feedback about the worm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body posture and coordinating the degree and timing of alternating contractions and relaxations of muscles (White et al., 1986; Tavernarakis et al., 1997). A similar proprioceptive property has been proven for the DVA neuron, in which stretch sensitivity is transduced by the trp-4 membrane channel (Li et al., 2006). The DVA axon travels from its cell body in the tail anteriorly to the NR via the VNC, but it is not known to show any specializations by TEM that mark its stretch-sensitive portion. PVD may have a role in proprioception, as ablation of PVD leads to defective posture (Albeg et al., 2011). PVD and DVA neurons are presynaptic to both forward and backing command interneurons and provide input to both anterior and posterior touch circuits to maintain overall activity of the circuits. Animals lacking these neurons respond to tap stimulus with diminished forward accelerations and reversals, and mutation of the trp-4 channel or laser ablation of DVA gives rise to animals with body bending defects (Wicks et al., 1996; Driscoll\u00a0 and Kaplan, 1997; Li et al., 2006)."

Many of the chemicals that are noxious for C. elegans are toxic or bitter for other animals as well, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), quinine, and heavy metals such as copper (Sambongi et al., 1999; Tobin and Bargmann, 2004). It should be noted that animals in diapause are much more stress-tolerant, including heat-shock conditions (Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999, see Dauer chapter). ASH neurons are polymodal nociceptors that detect nose touch, high osmotic strength (high concentration of salts or sugars), acidic pH, quinine and other bitter compounds, heavy metals, and aversive odors such as 2octanone, octanol, and benzaldehyde (NeuroTABLE 1). ASH neurons have cilia exposed to the outside and generate a rapid escape response in the form of reversal and turning upon encountering noxious stimuli (NeuroFIG 6) ( et al., 1986; Troemel et al., 1997; Hart et al., 1999). All ASH-mediated sensory behaviors require the TRPV channels OSM-9 and OCR-2 (Tobin et al., 2002).

ASH neurons are the main nociceptors and mediate avoidance from water-soluble and volatile cues. ASH is complemented by other amphid neurons in these functions; ADL neurons contribute to osmosensation and avoidance from octanol, copper, and cadmium, whereas ASK and ASE contribute to avoidance of SDS and to cadmium and copper, respectively (Sambongi et al., 1999; Hilliard et al., 2002).

Most of the time, the animals simply move forward (smooth runs), but this forward locomotion is occasionally interrupted by a number of processes such as omega-turns, pirouettes and gentle turning. During an omega-turn the worm makes a deep bend with the worm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head often contacting its tail, before the animal returns to forward motion along a new heading. Pirouettes are a series of reversals with one or more omega-turns that allow the worm to make major re-orientations in its direction of movement. Gentle turns (steering) are generated when the worm gradually changes its heading by a biased head swing during forward locomotion. Pirouettes appear to occur randomly, while steering appears to be a more directional process. Chemotaxis is driven by gently steering up the gradient as the wormmoves forward and by altering the probability of pirouette initiation by which runs toward lower concentration are interrupted, whereas runs toward the attractant are sustained, eventually biasing the locomotion toward the higher concentration of the chemical (Appelby, 2012; Pierce-Shimomura et al., 1999; Iino and Yoshida, 2009).\n\n 2.4.4 Thermosensation"

Following cultivation with food at temperatures ranging from 15\u00c2\u00b0C to 25\u00c2\u00b0C, it migrates to the cultivation temperature on a temperature gradient and continues to move isothermally at that temperature. In contrast, the animals disperse away from the temperature at which they were previously starved (Hedgecock and Russell, 1975; Mori, 1999). This thermal preference/avoidance behavior is plastic and can be reset to a new temperature associated with presence/absence of food within 2\u00e2\u0080\u00934 hours of cultivation at that temperature. Through thermotactic behavior, C. elegans can escape unfavorable environments and regulate its position in the upper levels of soil, which may display large vertical and temporal temperature gradients. Behaviorally, C. elegans migrates towards its preferred temperature by modulating its turning rate and run length as a function of temperature change. Once it reaches within 3\u00c2\u00b0C of its preferred temperature, it can fine-tune its tracking to 0.05\u00c2\u00b0C differences by constantly reorienting its head movement (Ryu and Samuel, 2002; de Bono and Maricq, 2005)"

AFD neurons have complex, brushlike structures at their dendritic ends that are completely embedded in the amphid sheath. Animals in which AFDs are killed are athermotactic. TAX-6 (calcineurin), three receptor-type guanylyl cyclases which function redundantly (GCY-8, GCY-18, and GCY-23), and cGMP-dependent TAX-2/TAX-4 cation channel have been shown to be involved in thermosensation in AFD (Kuhara et al., 2002; Inada et al., 2006). When tax-6 is mutated, animals display a thermophilic phenotype, whereas gcy-23 , gcy-8, and gcy-18 triple mutants show a cryophilic or athermotactic phenotype. In AWC, heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and cGMP-dependent TAX-4 cation channel are involved. In the current model for thermosensation, the downstream AIY interneuron is bidirectionally regulated by AFD and AWC. Thermosensory information is transmitted from AFD and AWC to AIY through EAT-4/VGLUT-dependent glutamatergic neurotransmission. Glutamatergic signals from AFD inhibit AIY via activation of GLC3 (glutamate-gated chloride channel) and induce migration towards colder temperature. Glutamatergic signals from AWC, on the other hand, stimulate AIY to induce migration towards warmer temperature (Kuhara et al, 2008; Ohnishi et al, 2011). When AI Y are killed animals become cryophilic and migrate to colder temperatures than the cultivation temperatures, while ablation of AIZ neurons, which are the main postsynaptic target of AIY, makes animals thermophilic and induce them to migrate to warmer temperatures (Mori, 1999)."

A prolonged exposure at 30\u00c2\u00b0C results in an induction of the heat-shock response and the animals cease egg-laying within a few hours (Lithgow et al., 1995), but resume reproduction if returned to lower temperatures (Aprison and Ruvinsky, 2014). Behaviorally, when they encounter a noxious heat source they respond with a reflexive withdrawal reaction (thermal avoidance response) (Liu et al., 2012; Wittenburg and Baumeister, 1999). PVD neurons in the body respond to acute cold shock, while AFD and FLP neurons in the head and PHC neurons in the tail sense noxious high temperatures (~35-38oC) (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010). This nociceptive heat response utilizes a different neural circuit than thermotaxis and the response of C. elegans to noxious high heat is modulated by glutamate and by the neuropeptides encoded in the flp-1 locus. Two channel protein families contribute to thermonociception in C. elegans in distinct neurons: the TAX-2/TAX-4 cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and thermal-gated TRPV channels (TRPA, TRPM and TRPV ion channel families are considered \"thermoTRPs\"; the gating of these channels by temperature is facilitated by chemical signals)(Hall & Treinin, 2011). Upon encountering noxious heat, TAX-2 and TAX-4 become activated in AFD neurons by cGMP which is mainly generated through the activity of GCY-12, but also to a lesser extent by GCY-8/18/23. In FLP and PHC neurons thermonociceptive signal transduction involves the OCR-2 and OSM-9 TRPV channels which can assemble into a heteromultimeric channel complex. PVD response to cold requires TRPA-1 channel (Chatzigeorgiou et al., 2010). \n\n 2.4.5 Light Sensation"

It can sustain a normal rate of metabolism between 2% and 21% ambient oxygen due to diffusion of oxygen to its tissues through the pseudocoelomic fluid, in which all tissues bathe (Van Voorhies and Ward, 2000). When cultivated under standard laboratory conditions, with a linear gradient from anoxia to atmospheric oxygen in the gas phase, C. elegans rapidly moves to an intermediate preferred oxygen concentration of between 7% and 14% oxygen, avoiding both high and low oxygen levels, although this response can be modified by environment and experience (Gray et al., 2004; Cheung et al., 2005; Rogers et al., 2006). In the wild, C. elegans lives close to decaying organic matter where it is exposed to an air/water interface with rapidly shifting oxygen tensions (0\u00e2\u0080\u009321%) due to consumption of oxygen by microbes. Ambient oxygen levels may, therefore, be perceived as indicating the presence of food by this animal. Oxygen sensation is performed by a distributed network of neurons that includes AQR, PQR, and URX, possibly gcy-35-expressing SDQ, ALN, and BDU, and osm-9-expressing (nociceptive) ADF and ASH neurons (White et al., 1986; Gray et al., 2004; Chang et al., 2006). AQR, PQR, and URX may perform a head-to-tail oxygen comparison achieved through their positions along the body in close contact with the pseudocoelom because they are suggested to function to monitor the pseudocoelomic fluid, including its oxygen content (NeuroFIG 11) (Rogers et al., 2006). AQR is a right-sided neuron, derived post-embryonically from the QR blast cell; PQR is a left-sided neuron, derived post-embryonically from the QL blast cell. Both have ciliated endings. The AQR ending is free within the pseudocoleomic cavity, whereas the PQR ending lies close to the pseudocoelom, but is wrapped by the phasmid socket cell (see Neuronal Supportal Cells). URX cell bodies lie within the pseudocoelomic cavity. Similar to URX, AQR, and PQR neurons, SDQ, BDU, ALN, and PLN express soluble guanylate cyclases (sGC) that bind to molecular oxygen, consistent with a primary oxygen-sensing function for these AQR neurons. SDQs are also similar in lineage, morphology, and neural connectivity to the AQR and PQR neurons. Additionally, nociceptive ADF and ASH neurons may be modulatory or respond to oxygen directly. The output of the aerotaxis neuron network converges on AVA, the command interneuron responsible for generating backward motion and, hence, avoidance. The presence or absence of food modulates the basic aerotactic responses of hypoxia and hyperoxia avoidance. Modulation of hyperoxia avoidance is accomplished through the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1, the transforming growth factor-\u00ce\u00b2 (TGF-\u00ce\u00b2)-related protein DAF-7, and serotonin production by the ADF neurons, whereas hypoxia avoidance seems to be mediated through a neuronal network that is independent of these pathways (Chang et al., 2006)."

Thus, the animal typically shows an acute avoidance response to CO2 (especially well-fed animals) when CO2 level is above 0.5%. Animals also respond to changes in ambient CO2 levels. Primary CO2 sensors are AFD, BAG and ASE neurons (Bretscher et al., 2011). The signal pathway for CO2 response in AFD and BAG include the TAX-2/TAX-4 cGMP-gated heteromeric channel and the atypical soluble guanylate cyclases that also mediate oxygen responses in BAG. AFD neurons respond to increasing CO2 by a fall and then rise in Ca2+  and show a Ca2+ spike when CO2 decreases. BAG and ASE are both activated by CO2 and remain tonically active while high CO2 persists. The CO2 responses in AFD, BAG and ASE neurons do not habituate upon multiple exposures to CO2. The modulators of the CO2 -response include physiological state of the worm, the neuropeptide Y receptor, NPR-1, and calcineurin subunits, TAX-6 and CNB-1."

Most of these processes run longitudinally along the body wall, except where they enter the NR. Most nerve cords are specialized to include limited functional groupings. For instance, the amphid nerves in the head and the phasmid nerves in the tail include only sensory dendrites and travel directly from sensory endings to related neuron cell bodies in local ganglia. Conversely, many neuron processes of the VNC, DC, and NR have mixed functions. The number and spatial arrangement of processes within the nerve tracts are essentially conserved between animals (White et al., 1976, 1983, 1986; Chalfie and White, 1988). Neighboring processes generally stay closely associated for long distances, and synapses are made en passant between adjacent processes. The neighborhoods, therefore, determine connectivity between neurons. Switching between neighborhoods, which most commonly occurs at the junctions of process bundles, increases the number of potential synaptic partners for a given neuron. The VNC is the major longitudinal nerve and splits posteriorly to the excretory pore into major (right side) and minor (left side) tracts that flank the ventral hypodermal ridge (NeuroFIG 5). In adult animals, the left VNC tract contains six processes and the right approximately 54 processes due to the decussation of the majority of fibers exiting the NR from the left side (Hedgecock et al., 1990). Near the junction of the NR, anterior to the decussation, the ventral ganglion region contains 170 processes. The VNC is continuous with the RVG at the anterior and with the PAG at the posterior end. Many of the tail neuron processes enter the right tract of the VNC, although a few enter the left tract."

Cytoplasmic dense material often surrounds some or all of these vesicles, making the release zone darker than the nearby axoplasm.

The anatomical features of these synapses are essentially the same as those for chemical synapses between neurons; however, one distinction is the basal lamina that separates the presynaptic motor neuron and the postsynaptic muscle. Basal-lamina-associated proteins nidogen/entactin (NID-1) and type XVIII (CLE-1) collagen are enriched near synaptic contacts. Nidogen is concentrated between the nerve cords and muscles, whereas CLE-1 is concentrated above the regions in which NMJs form (Ackley et al., 2003). Mutations in these basal lamina proteins lead to defects in the organization of NMJs. In contrast to most other organisms, muscles extend long, thin processes (arms) to nerve bundles to make synapses with the motor neurons in C. elegans. In many cases, chemical synapses onto muscle arms occur in specialized zones where several muscles extend arms that interdigitate to form a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmuscle plate\u00e2\u0080\u009d around a presynaptic specialization so that vesicle release from a single axon can simultaneously stimulate more than one muscle (White et al., 1976, 1986; Liu et al., 2006). In addition, there are often gap junctions between these muscle arms. For example, along the VNC and DC, muscle arms crowd around the presynaptic varicosities of the motor neurons to receive simultaneous input. Besides the VNC and DC, NMJs are also concentrated on the inside surface of the NR where muscle arms from head muscle rows arrange into a circumferential muscle plate. Unlike somatic muscles, pharyngeal muscles do not form arms, and presynaptic processes are often embedded directly in the muscle soma. In the male tail, presynaptic motor axons often terminate at the synapse, and again, contact is sometimes made directly onto the muscle soma for certain sex muscles.\n\n2.10.3 Electrical Synapses (see also chapter on Gap Junctions)"

They are found virtually in all tissues of C. elegans, and essential for embryogenesis (Phelan 2005). In the nervous system, gap junctions are made between neurons and between muscle cells (but not between neurons and muscle cells as they are generally separated by a basal lamina.) The adult C. elegans nervous system has about 600 highly reproducible neuronal gap junctions, in addition to the 5000 predicted chemical synapses (White et al., 1986). The number of gap junctions throughout the life cycle of the animal is likely much higher as some neuronal gap junctions are assembled during embryonic development but are remodeled in early larval stages and dissolved by the adult stage (Chuang et al., 2007). Between neurons, axon-to-axon and axosomatic contacts are common; soma-to-soma contacts are less common. Electrical synapses can occur at any locale within the nervous system; they are not restricted to any neuropil. These synapses may affect behavioral events by synchronizing neuronal activity, by cross-inhibition of neighboring axons, or by relaying signals along neighboring segmental regions from one homolog to another. Alternately, the gap junction may transmit metabolic signals. Some GJs have a developmental role in halting axon outgrowth when two homologous axons establish the limits of their neighboring territories, an event known as contact termination (White et al., 1986). These GJs between homologs are very common; many bilateral neuron pairs in the head encircle only half of the NR (cf. ASH, ASI, ASJ, etc.), because they stop when they encounter the process of their functional homolog to form a GJ. This property is also seen in VD motor neurons along the VNC. Important synaptic connections in the VNC can involve GJs between a command interneuron (AVA or AVB) and the cell body of a motor neuron (White et al., 1976, 1986). Other functions for gap junctions include regulation of asymmetric gene expression in a neuron pair and synchronization of neuron and muscle activities (e.g., synchronization of action potentials and Ca++ transients in body-wall muscle, Ca++ wave propogation during defecation motor program, facilitation of intermuscular electrical coupling for synchronous pharyngeal muscle contractions, transmission of signals among male-specific muscles during male copulation) (Liu et al, 2011a; Liu et al., 2011b; Chuang et al., 2007; Peters et al., 2007, Li et al, 2003). During embryogenesis transient gap junction networks may regulate formation of nascent circuits (Chuang et al., 2007)."

                        "contents": "GJs in nematodes are formed by intramembrane proteins called \u00e2\u0080\u009cinnexins,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which are completely different in their amino acid sequence from the vertebrate \u00e2\u0080\u009cconnexins.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Instead, they are the homologs of vertebrate \"pannexins\" (Starich et al., 1996; Phelan and Starich, 2001; Altun et al., 2009). They may coassemble to form homotypic, heterotypic and heteromeric gap junctions (NeuroFIG 22). Additionally, these molecules may form hemichannels that connect a cell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interior to the extracellular space, providing a pathway for release and uptake of molecules and ions in a controlled manner. In addition to eat-5 , unc-7 , and unc-9 , which had been discovered previously through mutant analyses, the completion of genomic sequencing of C. elegans revealed 22 more innexin genes (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium, 1998; Bargmann, 1998). These additional innexins were numbered arbitrarily from inx-1to inx-22. Further sequencing and genomic analysis of two additional Caenorhabditis species (C. briggsae and C. remanei) revealed that each of these species has retained at least one member of each type of these innexins, except inx-8 and , which share a single ortholog in C. briggsae, but have distinct orthologs in C. remanei (see Wormbase). This strongly suggests that each innexin gene is a true gene rather than a pseudogene. Among C. elegans innexins, there are 3 sets of polycistronic ones: inx-12 and inx-13 , inx-16 and inx-17 , and inx-21 , and inx-22. Individual GJs in neurons can involve heteromeric channels made from several different innexin subunits. Neuronal GJs differ from those in other nematode tissues by showing equal numbers of intramembrane particles in both the \u00e2\u0080\u009cE-face\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cP-face\u00e2\u0080\u009d (Hall, 1987). Through expression analyses all innexins except inx-5 , inx-15 , inx-16 , inx-20 , inx-21 , inx-22 , and eat-5 were found in the C. elegans nervous system (Altun et al., 2009). Among these, the most widely expressed innexins were inx-7 , unc-7 , and unc-9, while the least widely expressed ones were inx-1 , inx-2 , and inx-11. Also, TEM analyses revListealed that gap junctions exist between glia (socket and sheath cells) and hypodermis as well as between the socket and sheath cells, but not between glia and neurons (Altun et al., 2009)."
