It is an important model system for biological research in many fields including genomics, cell biology, neuroscience and aging (http://www.wormbook.org/). Among its many advantages for study are its short life cycle, compact genome, stereotypical development, ease of propagation and small size. The adult body plan is anatomically simple with about 1000 somatic cells. C. elegans is amenable to genetic crosses and produces a large number of progeny per adult. It reproduces with a life cycle of about 3 days under optimal conditions. The animal can be maintained in the laboratory where it is grown on agar plates or liquid cultures with E. coli as the food source. It can be examined at the cellular level in living preparations by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, because it is transparent throughout its life cycle. The anatomical description of the whole animal has been completed at the electron microscopy level and its complete cell lineage, which is invariant between animals, has been established (Brenner, 1973; Byerly et al., 1976; Sulston et al., 1983; Wood, 1988a; Lewis and Fleming, 1995)."

Males arise infrequently (0.1%) by spontaneous non-disjunction in the hermaphrodite germ line and at higher frequency (up to 50%) through mating. Self-fertilization of the hermaphrodite allows for homozygous worms to generate genetically identical progeny, and male mating facilitates the isolation and maintenance of mutant strains as well as moving mutations between strains."

The lumen of the pharynx is continuous with the lumen of the intestine, and the pharynx passes ground food into the intestine via the intestinal pharyngeal valve. The intestine, which is the only somatic tissue derived from a single (E blast cell) lineage, is made of 20 cells arranged to form a tube with a central lumen. The apical surfaces of the intestinal cells carry numerous microvilli. The intestinal contents are excreted to the outside via a rectal valve that connects the gut to the rectum and anus. The four enteric muscles that contribute to defecation are located around the rectum and posterior intestine (see Alimentary System Sections: Pharynx, Intestine and Rectum and Anus)."

The germ line within the distal gonad arms (ovaries) is syncytial with germline nuclei surrounding a central cytoplasmic core. More proximally, germ cells pass sequentially through the mitotic, meiotic prophase and diakinesis stages. As they pass through the bend of the gonad arm (oviduct), oocytes enlarge, detach from the syncytium, and mature as they move more proximally. The oocytes are fertilized by the sperm in spermatheca. The resulting diploid zygotes are stored in the uterus and laid outside thorough the vulva, which protrudes at the ventral midline (see Reproductive System: Somatic Gonad, Germ Line and Egg-laying Apparatus)."

Male C. elegans larvae initially display the same simple cylindrical body plan as hermaphrodites, but from the L2 stage onward, the shape of their posterior half changes as their sexual organs begin to develop (IntroFIG 5) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Sulston et al., 1980; Nguyen et al., 1999). With the exception of perhaps the pharynx and the excretory system, virtually all tissue systems exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. The most profound differences are seen in tissues of the posterior, which bears the male copulatory apparatus. The muscle system of the male contains 41 additional sex-specific muscles (see Male-Specific Muscles). The reproductive system consists of a single-armed gonad (IntroFIG 5C; Male Somatic Gonad and Germline) that opens to the exterior at the cloaca (anus) via a modified rectal epithelial chamber called the proctodeum (IntroFIG 5D) (see Proctodeum). The proctodeum includes two sclerotic sensory spicules used by the male during mating to locate the hermaphrodite vulval slit and to hold the vulva open during sperm transfer (Liu and Sternberg, 1995; Garcia et al., 2001). The nervous system has 91 additional neurons that include several classes of tail sensilla: the rays, which extend from the tail and lie in a cuticular fan (see Rays); the hook (see Hook); and the post-cloacal sensilla, which are located on the ventral exterior of the tail (see PCS)."

During this period, pharyngeal pumping ceases and the animal enters a brief lethargus (IntroFIG 6; IntroMOVIE 2)."

Proliferation (0 to 330-350 min post-fertilization at 22'C) includes cell divisions from a single cell to about 550 essentially undifferentiated cells by the end of the '16 E stage' (von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980; Wood, 1988b). This stage is further subdivided into two phases: The first phase (0-150 min) spans the time between zygote formation to generation of embryonic founder cells, and the second phase (150-350 min) covers the bulk of cell divisions and gastrulation until the beginning of organogenesis (Bucher and Seydoux, 1994). The initial 150 min of proliferation takes place within the mother's uterus, and the embryo is laid outside when it reaches the approximate 30-cell stage (at gastrulation). There is considerable rearrangement of cells in the proliferation stage because of short-range shuffling, and once gastrulation begins, because of specific cell migrations (during gastrulation Ea and Ep sink in from the posterior and enter into the embryo at 100 min after first cell cleavage. P4 and MS progeny enter at 120-200 min, followed by C and D myoblasts entering from the posterior. AB-derived pharynx progenitors enter inside at 210-250 min. Once the cell migrations are completed, ventral cleft through which cells migrated in closes proceeding from the posterior (230 min) to anterior. Ventral cleft closure is completed at 290 min.) From this time onward, the embryonic substages can be defined by specific cell migrations, gain in cell number, and periods of synchronous stem-cell divisions."

During the organogenesis/morphogenesis stage (5.5-6 hr to 12-14 hr), terminal differentiation of cells occurs without many additional cell divisions, and the embryo elongates threefold and takes form as an animal with fully differentiated tissues and organs. Morphogenesis starts with the 'lima bean' stage. The first muscle twitches are observed at 430 min after the first cell cleavage (between 1.5- and 2-fold stages) (IntroFIG 7). Sexual dimorphism becomes visible for the first time at 510 minutes when the cephalic companion neurons (CEMs) die in the hermaphrodite, and when the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) die in the male. In the late three-fold stage, the worm can move inside the egg in a coordinated fashion (rolling around its longitudinal axis), indicating advanced motor system development. The embryo starts pharyngeal pumping at 760 min after the first cell cleavage and hatches at 800 min (von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980; Sulston et al, 1983; Bird and Bird, 1991)."

In the presence of food, cell divisions resume and the post-embryonic developmental program begins 3 hours after hatching (Ambros, 2000). The animal normally passes through four larval stages to reach adulthood (IntroFIG 8, IntroMOVIE 2). Numerous blast cells set aside at the end of embryogenesis divide in nearly invariant temporal and spatial patterns through the four larval stages and give rise to a fixed number of cells with determined fates (see Cell lineages; Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Wood 1988b). Of the 671 nuclei generated in the embryo, 113 undergo programmed death in the course of development (Sulston et al, 1983; Bird, and Bird, 1991). About 10% of the remaining 558 cells in a newly hatched larva (51 in hermaphrodites, 55 in the male) are blast cells that will divide further (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980). If the embryos hatch in the absence of food, however, they arrest development until food becomes available. Such larvae can survive up to 6-10 days without feeding (IntroFIG 6) (Johnson et al., 1984). After food becomes available, these arrested L1 stage larvae progress through normal molting and development (Slack and Ruvkun, 1997).\n\n3.2.1 L1 Larva"

A few other neurons are generated from Q, G1, H2 and T blast cells. Also, during the L1 stage, one class of ventral cord motor neurons (DDn) go through complete synaptic reorganization without any cell-shape change. The initial pattern of synapses made by DD neurons is presynaptic and inhibitory to ventral body wall muscles, while being postsynaptic to neurons that activate dorsal body wall muscles. During late L1, after the birth of VD motor neurons, DD neurons change their synaptic pattern such that their dorsal branches become presynaptic and inhibitory to dorsal body wall muscles, whereas their ventral branches become postsynaptic to excitatory neurons that synapse on ventral body wall muscles (White et al., 1978; Walthall et al., 1993)."

The critical period for this dauer signal begins after the middle of the first larval stage.\u00a0The L2d larva retains the potential to form either a dauer larva or an L3 larva, depending on the persistence of the dauer inducing environmental parameters (Riddle, 1988). If the environment continues to be disadvantageous, the L2d-stage larva molts into a dauer (IntroFIG 6). The dauer is a non-aging state because its duration does not affect postdauer life span. During the dauer state, feeding is arrested indefinitely and locomotion is markedly reduced. The dauer state ends when the animal experiences favorable conditions.

As posterior blast cells divide, the tail become visibly swollen when viewed under the dissecting scope (IntroFIG 5E). Posterior Pn.p cells divide to add 16 cells to the preanal ganglion. More anterior Pn.p lineages contribute cells to the ventral nerve cord. Rectal lineages produce proctodeal cells and several tail sensilla (Sulston et al., 1980; Sulston, 1988). In the male germline, which produces only sperm, meiosis begins during L3 stage.\n\n3.2.5 L4 Larva"

The distal gonad arms continue their migration centripetally along the dorsal body wall muscles, and by the L4/adult molt, they complete their trajectory close to midline (Antebi et al, 1997). Meiosis in the germ line begins at L3/L4 molt in the proximal arms of the gonad, and the germ cells differentiate into mature sperm. At the L4/adult molt, sperm production stops and the remaining germline cells  continue to undergo meiosis and differentiation to generate exclusively oocytes instead. Vulval and uterine terminal cell generation is followed by tissue morphogenesis (IntroFIG 8G). Egg-laying neurons (VCs and HSNs) and sex muscles, generated from sex myoblasts, associate with these structures to form the egg-laying apparatus. (Greenwald, 1997)."

The cells around the rectum form the proctodeum. This epithelium expands to surround the cloacal chamber, which contains the spicules. The gonad continues to grow posteriorly along the ventral midline, and the vas deferens and the seminal vesicle differentiate. The linker cell reaches the developing cloaca by mid-L4 where it dies and is then engulfed by two cells of the proctodeum, thereby opening the vas deferens to the outside (Sulston, 1988; Antebi et al., 1997). Tail tip hypodermal cells remodel, generating the rounded tail of the adult (IntroFIG 5E) (Nguyen et al., 1999). The tail seam (SET) is formed. Eventually, a general forward movement of posterior tissues and collapse of the cuticle reshape the male tail and generates the copulatory bursa with rays and fan, as well as the ventral hook and post-cloacal sensilla (Emmons and Sternberg, 1997).\n\n3.2.6 Adult"

The adult hermaphrodite produces oocytes for about 4 days, and after this fertile period of 3-4 days, the mature adult lives for an additional 10-15 days. A hermaphrodite that self-fertilizes can produce about 300 progeny because of the limited number of sperm, but if mating with a male occurs, the progeny number can increase to 1200-1400. Males can successfully mate with a hermaphrodite for 6 days after their last larval molt and can father approximately 3000 progeny (Hodgkin, 1988)."

Hence, the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite has 959 somatic nuclei, 302 of which are neurons and 95 are body wall muscle cells (White, 1988). The adult male, on the other hand, has 1031 somatic nuclei and 381 of these are neurons (extra neurons are mostly dedicated to male mating behavior) (White, 1988). Although it has more cells, the adult C. elegans male is more slender and slightly shorter (approx. 0.8 mm) than the hermaphrodite (IntroFIG5).
