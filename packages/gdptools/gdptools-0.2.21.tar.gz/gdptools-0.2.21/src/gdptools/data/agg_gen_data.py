    Data provided in one of UserData inherited classes will be prepped for aggregation,
    including subsetting the gridded data by the features bounding box, and by the time-
    period selected.  In addition if the gridded data is defined between 0-360 degrees
    longitude it will be shifted to -180 - 180 degrees.  For each variable in the
    user_data attribute of either the WeightGen or AggGen classes, a dict of
    {var: AggData} will be generated in the AggGen.calculate_agg() method.

    Args:
    ----
        variable (str): Variable name.
        cat_cr (CatClimRItem): CatClimRItem data class containing grid metadata.
        da: (DataArray): The spatially and temporally subsetted variable DataArray.
        feature (GeoDataFrame): The user-supplied feature file represented as a
            GeoDataFrame.
        id_feature (str): The feature id (column header) in the GeoDataFrame.
        period (List[str]): A list of dates representing the starting and ending date to
            process.
