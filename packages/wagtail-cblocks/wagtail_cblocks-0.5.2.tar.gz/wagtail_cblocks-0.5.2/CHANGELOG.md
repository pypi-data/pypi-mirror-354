## Unreleased

## 0.5.2 - 2025-06-11
### Fixed
- Set empty dict when block's value to migrate with `MergeLinkBlockOperation`
  is empty

## 0.5.1 - 2024-08-09
### Fixed
- Update `LinkTargetBlock` JavaScript code to support Wagtail >=6.1

## 0.5.0 - 2024-06-05
### Changed
- **Breaking:** Merge `LinkBlock` to `LinkTargetBlock` and change it to a
  `StructBlock`.

  A migration operation is provided to migrate your current blocks and prevent
  data loss but you will have to apply it manually:
  1. Switch to this new `wagtail_cblocks` version
  2. Update your code to use `LinkTargetBlock` instead of `LinkBlock`
  3. Create migration(s) for you app(s) - it will update `Streamfield` blocks
  4. Edit this new migration file
  5. Add the following imports at the top:
     ```python
     from wagtail.blocks.migrations.migrate_operation import MigrateStreamData
     from wagtail_cblocks.blocks.migrations.operations import MergeLinkBlockOperation
     ```
  6. Use the `MergeLinkBlockOperation` to migrate all of your `StreamField` which
     are impacted - i.e. which have a `LinkBlock` somewhere - as described in the
     [Wagtail's documentation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/advanced_topics/streamfield_migrations.html#basic-usage).
     Note that the block path must be the full path of the `LinkBlock`, for
     example:
     ```python
     operations = [
         MigrateStreamData(
             app_name="myapp",
             model_name="contentpage",
             field_name="body",
             operations_and_block_paths=[
                 (
                     MergeLinkBlockOperation(),
                     "button_block.link",
                 ),
                 (
                     MergeLinkBlockOperation(),
                     "image_block.link",
                 ),
                 (
                     MergeLinkBlockOperation(),
                     "columns_block.columns.button_block.link",
                 ),
                 (
                     MergeLinkBlockOperation(),
                     "columns_block.columns.image_block.link",
                 ),
             ],
         ),
         # â€¦
     ]
     ```
