# ====== Code Summary ======
# This module defines `PPTXExtractor`, a subclass of `BaseExtractor`, designed to extract text
# from PowerPoint `.pptx` files using `python-pptx`. It also includes a method `describe_image`
# to send images to an OpenAI model for captioning (currently commented out).
# The class logs all steps of the extraction and handles both text and image content.
