# ====== Code Summary ======
# This module defines `TXTExtractor`, a subclass of `BaseExtractor`, which is responsible for extracting
# raw text from plain `.txt` files using built-in Python I/O functions. It reads the entire content
# of the file and raises appropriate exceptions for file access errors.
