rtcqs
=====

Introduction
------------

rtcqs is a Python utility to analyze your system and detect possible 
bottlenecks that could have a negative impact on the performance of your 
system when working with Linux audio. It is heavily inspired by raboof's 
excellent `realtimeconfigquickscan 
<https://github.com/raboof/realtimeconfigquickscan>`_
script.

Features
--------

Basically the same as realtimeconfigquickscan:

- Root check
- Audio group check
- CPU frequency check
- High resolution timers check
- Preempt RT check
- rtprio check
- Swappiness check
- Filesystem check

Additional features:

- Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT, also known as hyper-threading) check
- Spectre/Meltdown mitigations check
- Basic IRQ check of sound cards and USB ports
- Power management check
- tkinter GUI

Installation
------------
GUI
```
If you want to use the GUI you will have to install the ``python3-tk`` 
package or similar for your distro.

Virtual Environment
```````````````````
Make sure the ``pip`` and the Python virtual environment module packages are
installed, on Ubuntu these would be ``python3-pip`` and ``python3-venv``. Then
create a virtual environment in a directory of choice and install rtcqs in
there.

::

  mkdir -p ~/path/to/rtcqs
  cd ~/path/to/rtcqs
  python3 -m venv venv &&
  . venv/bin/activate &&
  pip install --upgrade rtcqs

You can now run rtcqs by simply running ``rtcqs`` in a terminal. The GUI can 
be run with ``rtcqs_gui``. Next time you'd like to run the script or the GUI
load the virtual environment again and run either ``rtcqs`` or ``rtcqs_gui``.

::

  . venv/bin/activate
  rtcqs
  rtcqs_gui

Editable Installation
`````````````````````
It is also possible to use a so-called "editable installation". This allows you
to run the commands directly, without having to load the virtual environment.

::

  mkdir -p ~/path/to/rtcqs
  cd ~/path/to/rtcqs
  git clone https://codeberg.org/rtcqs/rtcqs.git .
  python3 -m venv venv
  venv/bin/pip install -e .

You can now run rtcqs by running ``~/path/to/rtcqs/venv/bin/rtcqs`` in a
terminal. The GUI can be run with ``~/path/to/rtcqs/venv/bin/rtcqs_gui``.

Overview
````````

When running the GUI it will immediately show the results of the checks. All 
checks have their own tab. Each tab title consists of a symbol that shows the 
check result and the name of the check. A ✔ means the check was successful 
while a ✘ means rtcqs encountered an issue. This way you can quickly spot 
which checks have issues.

Clicking 'Cancel' will close rtcqs. Clicking 'About' will bring up a popup 
window which displays the version and a short description.

Future plans
------------

- Disk scheduler check (first asses what impact different schedulers have on
  performance)
- Improve swappiness check (get amount of RAM and work with that)
- Ditch PySimpleGUI which is not open source anymore and move to pygubu or
  even popsicle (how audio would that be)

Many thanks of course to the original author of realtimeconfigquickscan,
