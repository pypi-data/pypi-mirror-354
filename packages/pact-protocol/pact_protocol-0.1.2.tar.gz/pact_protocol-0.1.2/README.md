NeuroBloom.ai is building resilient infrastructure for the future of agent communication and coordination.

We believe the next evolution of AI won't be dominated by monolithic models‚Äîbut by networks of agents that understand intent, cooperate intelligently, and recover gracefully.

Our open-source protocol, PACT (Protocol for Agent Collaboration & Transfer), lays the foundation for this future.

We‚Äôre not just building software‚Äîwe're building trust, interoperability, and invisible systems that last.

Join us in shaping agent ecosystems that are resilient, ethical, and collaborative by design.

## üåç Vision

In an increasingly agent-driven world, PACT provides a simple, open, and scalable protocol for **intent translation** and **agent interoperability** ‚Äî enabling diverse AI agents, platforms, and services to collaborate seamlessly.

> "Let every agent have its mind... PACT translates their intents."
>
Why PACT Matters?:

PACT exists to replace confusion with clarity. To transform fragmented systems into collaborative ecosystems. So builders can spend less time duct-taping intent and more time building tools that matter.

## üöÄ Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aknbloom/pact_adapter_mvp.git
cd pact_adapter_mvp
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

### Usage

Send a POST request to the `/translate` endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/translate \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "pact_version": "0.1",
    "message_id": "abc123",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-14T12:00:00Z",
    "sender": { "agent_id": "agent-A", "platform": "Dialogflow" },
    "recipient": { "agent_id": "agent-B", "platform": "Rasa" },
    "session": { "session_id": "xyz-123", "context": {} },
    "payload": {
      "intent": "check_order_status",
      "entities": { "order_id": "A123456" },
      "text": "Where is my order?"
    }
  }'
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "translated_message": {
    "intent": "order.lookup",
    "entities": {
      "order_id": "A123456"
    },
    "text": "Where is my order?"
  }
}
```

## Architecture

PACT As a Translation Layer

![PACT As a Translation Layer](docs/images/PACT_As_a_Translation_Layer.png)

The following diagram illustrates the PACT message flow:

![PACT Flow Diagram](docs/images/pact_agent_resilience_architecture.png)

- **PACT Gateway** ‚Üí **ML Intent Classifier** ‚Üí **Intent Translator** ‚Üí **Agent Router** ‚Üí **Adapter Layer** ‚Üí **Target Agent** ‚Üí **Response Handler**
- Resilient design with fallbacks for low-confidence intents, adapter failures, and timeouts.

Key components:
- **PACT Gateway**: Validates incoming message envelope format
- **ML Intent Classifier**: Determines intent with confidence score
- **Intent Translator**: Maps between different intent naming formats
- **Agent Router**: Selects appropriate target agent
- **Adapter Layer**: Converts to target platform's message format
- **Target Agent**: Processes the intent and generates a response
- **Response Handler**: Wraps response in standard PACT envelope
- **Resilient Design**: Built-in fallback mechanisms for low-confidence intents, timeouts, and adapter failures
- **Platform-Agnostic**: Works with any conversational AI platform

Protocol design isn't just about what works ‚Äî it's about what fails gracefully and secures trust at every layer.
How PACT's security and resilience loop works (e.g., Inputs ‚Üí Threat Modeling ‚Üí Protocol Refinement ‚Üí Resilience Mechanisms)?
