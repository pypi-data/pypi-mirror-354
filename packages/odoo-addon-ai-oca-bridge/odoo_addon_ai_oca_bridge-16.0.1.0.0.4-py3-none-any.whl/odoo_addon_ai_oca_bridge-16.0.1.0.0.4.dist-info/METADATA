Use Cases / Context
===================

Right now, there are 2 different approaches for AI integration with
Odoo:

1. Make everything inside Odoo.
2. Make it using other tools and integrate Odoo with these tools.

IMO, it would be better to make use of option 2 for different reasons:

- Odoo server is intended as a transactional system. AI systems requires
  other kind of characteristics
- Everything changes too fast. I am not confident that Odoo can keep the
  pace in this topic
- There are OSS tools that fills the gap perfectly and are created just
  for this topic.

Anyway, OCA is open to everyone and we don't intend to force an
opinionated way of doing. For this reason, we have this module, that can
be used as Bridge with AI systems.

Configuration
=============

As an administrator access ``AI Bridge\AI Bridge``.

Create a new bridge. Define the name, model, url and configuration.

On the external system, you will receive a POST payload with the
following information:

- \_id
- \_model
- Fields selected

In order to improve the view of the AI configuration, use groups and
domain to set better filters.

Usage
=====

Use the bolt widget in the chatter to execute the different AI options.

The options will be filtered according to the configuration.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Define examples to use and import
- Allow child fields. Right now, only first level fields are accepted.
- Information popover is not working properly when there is large data.
- Add an option to know when the AI task is asynchronous and comunicate
  to the user once it has been finished.
