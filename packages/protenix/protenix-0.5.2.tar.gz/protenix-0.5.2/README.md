We‚Äôre excited to introduce **Protenix** ‚Äî a trainable, open-source PyTorch reproduction of [AlphaFold 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07487-w).

Protenix is built for high-accuracy structure prediction. It serves as an initial step in our journey toward advancing accessible and extensible research tools for the computational biology community.

Protenix-v0.5.0 was trained using a PDB cut-off date of September 30, 2021. For the comparative analysis, we adhered to AF3‚Äôs inference protocol, generating 25 predictions by employing 5 model seeds, with each seed yielding 5 diffusion samples. The predictions were subsequently ranked based on their respective ranking scores.

We will soon release the benchmarking toolkit, including the evaluation datasets, data curation pipeline, and metric calculators, to support transparent and reproducible benchmarking.


## üõ† Installation

### PyPI

```bash
pip3 install protenix
```

For development on a CPU-only machine, it is convenient to install with the `--cpu` flag in editable mode:
```
python3 setup.py develop --cpu
```

### Docker (Recommended for Training)

Check the detailed guide: [<u> Docker Installation</u>](docs/docker_installation.md).


## üöÄ Inference

### Expected Input & Output Format
For details on the input JSON format and expected outputs, please refer to the [Input/Output Documentation](docs/infer_json_format.md).


### Prepare Inputs

#### Convert PDB/CIF File to Input JSON

If your input is a `.pdb` or `.cif` file, you can convert it into a JSON file for inference.


```bash
# ensure `release_data/ccd_cache/components.cif` or run:
python scripts/gen_ccd_cache.py -c release_data/ccd_cache/ -n [num_cpu]

# for PDB
# download pdb file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.pdb
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.pdb --out_dir ./output

# for CIF (same process)
# download cif file
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/7pzb.cif
# run with pdb/cif file, and convert it to json file for inference.
protenix tojson --input examples/7pzb.cif --out_dir ./output
```


#### (Optional) Prepare MSA Files

We provide an independent MSA search utility. You can run it using either a JSON file or a protein FASTA file.
```bash
# run msa search with json file, it will write precomputed msa dir info to a new json file.
protenix msa --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output

# run msa search with fasta file which only contains protein.
protenix msa --input examples/prot.fasta --out_dir ./output
```

### Inference via Command Line

If you installed `Protenix` via `pip`, you can run the following command to perform model inference:


```bash
# the default n_cycle/n_step/n_samples is 10/200/5 respectively, you can modify it by passing --cycle x1 --step x2 --sample x3

# run with example.json, which contains precomputed msa dir.
protenix predict --input examples/example.json --out_dir  ./output --seeds 101

# run with multiple json files, the default seed is 101.
protenix predict --input ./jsons_dir/ --out_dir  ./output

# if the json do not contain precomputed msa dir,
# add --use_msa_server to search msa and then predict.
# if mutiple seeds are provided, split them by comma.
protenix predict --input examples/example_without_msa.json --out_dir ./output --seeds 101,102 --use_msa_server
```

### Inference via Bash Script
Alternatively you can run inference by:
Alternatively, run inference via script:

```bash
bash inference_demo.sh
```

The script accepts the following arguments:
* `input_json_path`: Path to a JSON file that fully specifies the input structure.
* `dump_dir`: Directory where inference results will be saved.
* `dtype`: Data type used during inference. Supported options: `bf16` and `fp32`.
* `use_msa`: Whether to enable MSA features (default: true).
* `use_esm`: Whether to enable ESM features (default: false).


> **Note**: By default, layernorm and EvoformerAttention kernels are disabled for simplicity.
> To enable them and speed up inference, see the [**Kernels Setup Guide**](docs/kernels.md).


## üß¨ Training

Refer to the [Training Documentation](docs/training.md) for setup and details.

## üìå Constraint Feature

Protenix now allows users to specify ***contacts***, enabling the model to leverage additional inter-chain information as constraint guidance! We benchmarked this feature on the PoseBusters dataset and a curated protein-antibody interface subset.  Results show that Protenix can generate significantly more accurate structures when guided by constraints. You can try it out via the [`constraint_esm`](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix/tree/constraint_esm) branch.

![Constraint Metrics](assets/constraint_metrics.png)

> **Tips:** Our online service already supports constraint inputs ‚Äî no local setup required!
However, for local command-line usage, be sure to check out the [`constraint_esm`](https://github.com/bytedance/Protenix/tree/constraint_esm) branch, as this feature is not yet included in the main branch.


## Training and Inference Cost
