## Welcome to Nesta's Skills Extractor Library

Welcome to the documentation of Nesta's skills extractor library.

This page contains information on how to install and use Nesta's skills extraction library. The skills library allows you to extract skills phrases from job advertisement texts and maps them onto a skills taxonomy of your choice.

We currently support three different taxonomies to map onto: the [European Commission‚Äôs European Skills, Competences, and Occupations (ESCO)](https://esco.ec.europa.eu/en/about-esco/what-esco), [Lightcast‚Äôs Open Skills](https://skills.lightcast.io/) and a ‚Äútoy‚Äù taxonomy developed internally for the purpose of testing.

If you'd like to learn more about the models used in the library, please refer to the [model card page](https://nestauk.github.io/ojd_daps_skills/model_card).

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

To install as a package:

```
pip install ojd-daps-skills
```

> üêç **NOTE:** If you are using a conda environment you may need to do `conda install scipy` before pip installing this library.

> ‚è≥ **NOTE:** The first time you import `SkillsExtractor` in python it will take some time (around a minute) to load.

To extract skills from a job advert:

```
from ojd_daps_skills.extract_skills.extract_skills import SkillsExtractor

sm = SkillsExtractor(taxonomy_name="toy") # Can also use "esco" or "lightcast" here

job_ads = [
    "The job involves communication skills and maths skills",
    "The job involves Excel skills. You will also need good presentation skills",
    "You will need experience in the IT sector.",
]
job_ad_with_skills = sm(job_ads)
```

To access the extracted and mapped skills for each inputted job advert:

```
for job_ad_with_skills_doc in job_ad_with_skills:
  print(f"Job advert: {job_ad_with_skills_doc}")
  # print raw ents (i.e. multiskills are not split, also include 'BENEFIT' and 'EXPERIENCE' spans)
  print(f"Entities found: {[(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in job_ad_with_skills_doc.ents]}")
  # print SKILL spans (where SKILL spans are predicted as multiskills, split them)
  print(f"Skill spans: {job_ad_with_skills_doc._.skill_spans}")
  # print mapped skills to the "toy" taxonomy
  print(f"Skills mapped: {job_ad_with_skills_doc._.mapped_skills}")
  print("\n")
```

Which returns:

```
Job advert: The job involves communication skills and maths skills
Entities found: [('communication skills', 'SKILL'), ('maths skills', 'SKILL')]
Skill spans: [communication skills, maths skills]
Skills mapped: [{'ojo_skill': 'communication skills', 'ojo_skill_id': 3144285826919113, 'match_skill': 'communication, collaboration and creativity', 'match_score': 0.75, 'match_type': 'most_common_level_1', 'match_id': 'S1'}, {'ojo_skill': 'maths skills', 'ojo_skill_id': 1654958883999821, 'match_skill': 'working with computers', 'match_score': 0.6666666666666666, 'match_type': 'most_common_level_1', 'match_id': 'S5'}]


Job advert: The job involves Excel skills. You will also need good presentation skills
Entities found: [('Excel', 'SKILL'), ('presentation skills', 'SKILL')]
Skill spans: [Excel, presentation skills]

Job advert: You will need experience in the IT sector.
Entities found: [('experience in the IT sector', 'EXPERIENCE')]
Skill spans: []
Skills mapped: []
